Home Entertainment and DC announced the March 24 Digital release, and April 7 VOD release, of Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn. Directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) from a script by Christina Hodson (Bumblebee), the film is based on characters from DC.\n\nMargot Robbie (Bombshell, Once Upon a Time in\u2026Hollywood, I, Tonya) reprises her role as the endearingly daring ne\u2019er-do-well Harley Quinn. The main cast also includes Mary Elizabeth Winstead (10 Cloverfield Lane, TV\u2019s Fargo) as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell (True Blood) as Black Canary, Rosie Perez (Fearless, Pitch Perfect 2) as Renee Montoya, Chris Messina (Argo, Sharp Objects) as Victor Zsasz, and Ewan McGregor (Doctor Sleep, Trainspotting) as DC Super-Villain Roman Sionis/Black Mask. Newcomer Ella Jay Basco also stars as Cassandra \u201cCass\u201d Cain in her feature film debut.\n\nBirds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn was produced by Robbie, Bryan Unkeless and Sue Kroll. Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman, Geoff Johns, Hans Ritter and David Ayer served as executive producers.\n\nThe creative team, led by Yan, included director of photography Matthew Libatique (A Star Is Born, Venom), production designer K.K. Barrett (Her), editors Jay Cassidy (American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook) and Evan Schiff (John Wick Chapters 2 & 3) and costume designer Erin Benach (A Star Is Born). The music is by Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse).\n\nIn the film, when Gotham\u2019s most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz (Chris Messina), put a target on a young girl named Cass (Ella Jay Basco), the city is turned upside down looking for her. Harley (Margot Robbie), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Renee Montoya\u2019s (Rosie Perez) paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.\n\nDIGITAL ELEMENTS\n\nBirds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn features the following special features*:\n\nBirds Eye View Mode\n\nBirds of Prey: Birds of a Feather\n\nGrime and Crime\n\nWild Nerds\n\nRomanesque\n\nSanity is Sooo Last Season\n\nA Love/Skate Relationship\n\nGag Reel\n\n*Special features available from select digital retailers\n\nDIGITAL DISTRIBUTION ELEMENTS\n\nOn March 24, Birds of Prey and the Fabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn will be available to own in high definition and standard definition from select digital retailers including Amazon, FandangoNOW, iTunes, PlayStation, Vudu, Xbox and others.
