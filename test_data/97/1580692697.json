70.\n\nHe spent six weeks in hospital in Oviedo after developing symptoms following a trip to a literary festival in Portugal.\n\nSep\u00falveda became internationally known after the publication of his novel The Old Man Who Read Love Stories in 1988.\n\nA socialist, he was imprisoned in Chile under the military rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet before going into exile.\n\nHe was one of the many left-wing writers, activists and intellectuals targeted by the right-wing general who overthrew socialist President Salvador Allende in 1973.\n\nSep\u00falveda was jailed in 1973 for treason and spent two-and-a-half years in prison, a period he later wrote about in Madness of Pinochet and other articles.\n\nHe was freed as a result of pressure from rights group Amnesty International and lived in hiding in Chile for a year before being arrested again and sent into exile.\n\nDhaka/Mukul", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Best-selling Chilean writer Luis Sep\u00falveda has died of Covid-19 in
