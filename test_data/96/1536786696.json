The Thanksgiving break is scheduled to begin after the end of classes on Tuesday, Nov. 24.\n\nBefore Fall 2016, the University did not hold classes only on the holiday or the day after. In 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, an extended break was implemented. No classes were held between Monday and Friday, allowing students to leave the campus for over a week.\n\nDespite the amount of signatures to the petition, University Registrar Patrick Sullivan said in an email, \u201cAt this late date, I do not foresee a scenario where the University will change the calendar for Fall 2020.\u201d\n\nSullivan said the subcommittee chose the Tuesday as the final day of classes rather than the Wednesday to allow for an additional day of travel time for students. In the Fall 2021 semester, the Thanksgiving break will begin on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving.\n\nDavid Morin, a graduate student who was on the AMC subcommittee, said the matter of Thanksgiving break was \u201cdiscussed extensively\u201d when the calendar was developed. According to Morin, the \u201cmost important thing\u201d was to have the same number of each weekday schedule throughout the semester.\n\n\u201cOnce the idea of starting before Labor Day was rejected, the reduced Thanksgiving break, I think, was the best option,\u201d Morin said.\n\nThe University traditionally begins the fall semester after Labor Day, a federal holiday on the first Monday in September. In 2020, Labor Day falls on Sept. 7, the latest possible date.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of opposition to starting the semester before Labor Day,\u201d Morin said.\n\nSullivan said a post-Labor Day start is the \u201cstandard\u201d of the academic calendar: \u201cThere are several obstacles to an earlier start including schedule coordination with the Five Colleges.\u201d\n\nSmith College, Hampshire College and Mount Holyoke College will have the same Thanksgiving break as UMass; only Amherst College has the full week off in 2020.\n\nIn fall semesters where Labor Day is later, there are not enough available weekdays before Christmas Eve to accommodate 65 class days, state holidays, a reading day, five days of finals, a snow day and a full week at Thanksgiving, Sullivan explained.\n\n\u201cThis led to the shortening of the Thanksgiving break by two days, as it really was the only feasible option available,\u201d Sullivan added.\n\nMorin said, \u201cAlso, there was talk of having final exams on the final Saturday or Sunday and that idea was rejected.\u201d\n\nOut-of-state students who signed the petition said the change would greatly affect their travel plans. 23 percent of the undergraduate student population in fall 2019 was from outside of Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cI only go home on the larger breaks since I am from Long Island, New York,\u201d Alana Zeilander, a journalism undergraduate said. Her trip home takes up to six hours as there is no direct bus. \u201cThis whole day affair makes the trip not worth it for me unless I will be home for a longer period of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the university should follow others and start classes in mid-August or the beginning of September,\u201d Zeilander said when asked whether ending later in the semester would be preferable.\n\nAnother undergraduate student who signed the petition, Caroline Smith, agreed with Zeilander, saying that Sept. 8 was a very late start date. A native of Maryland, Smith heard about the petition from a friend and decided to sign it because she felt having a longer Thanksgiving break was necessary.\n\n\u201cI only really go home during each break, three times during the school year,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe drive is seven hours which is too long to go home for a random weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI enjoy the long break because it is one of the few times I get to see my family,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHaving many days in between the time that I drive home and the time that I drive back ensures I am well rested and mentally prepared for my journey.\u201d\n\nIn his email, Morin said the calendar committee has been \u201cvery behind-the-scenes\u201d in his experience, noting an attempt to reduce the add/drop period from two weeks to one week.\n\n\u201cI stopped that once I found out by coordinating with SGA leadership,\u201d Morin explained, pointing out there was no student representation at the meeting where the add/drop period was discussed. \u201c\u2026We were able to block the reduction in the Academic Matters Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy recollection is that I was the only student present on the Calendar Committee when the reduced Thanksgiving break was discussed,\u201d Morin added.\n\nKathrine Esten can be reached at [email protected] and followed on Twitter at @KathrineEsten.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kathrine Esten", "Assistant News Editor"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After four years of an extended Thanksgiving break, students at the University of Massachusetts will now have two days of classes before the holiday.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://dailycollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/favicon-solid-red-1.png", "meta_data": {"distribution": "global", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "language": "en, sv", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "og": {"title": "Shorter Thanksgiving break leads to student petition", "url": "https://dailycollegian.com/2020/03/shorter-thanksgiving-break-leads-to-student-petition/", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://dailycollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8221960418_7fc75c3d67_b-e1365673599134.jpg", "secure_url": "https://dailycollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/8221960418_7fc75c3d67_b-e1365673599134.jpg", "width": 979, "height": 499}, "site_name": "Massachusetts Daily Collegian", "description": "After four years of an extended Thanksgiving break, students at the University of Massachusetts will now have two days of classes before the holiday."}, "author": "Kathrine Esten", "description": "After four years of an extended Thanksgiving break, students at the University of Massachusetts will now have two days of classes before the holiday.", "article": {"section": "Archives"}}, "canonical_link": "https://dailycollegian.com/2020/03/shorter-thanksgiving-break-leads-to-student-petition/"}
