State and local authorities have restricted entry in Colima, M\u00e9xico state, Baja California Sur, Chiapas and Chihuahua as well.\n\nSegob also called out authorities who have initiated curfews in 31 municipalities in Guerrero, Michoac\u00e1n, Quintana Roo, Yucat\u00e1n, Jalisco, Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Morelos, Coahuila and Nuevo Le\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cThe patrols, closures of state or municipal borders, are severe restrictions to free transit. The states and municipalities do not have the authority to order them, unless they have express authorization from the General Health Council to set up screening checkpoints,\u201d said Segob human rights Deputy Minister Alejandro Encinas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to emphasize that access points controlled by indigenous citizens or authorities tend not to have adequate health measures or satisfactory practices for dealing with Covid-19. That\u2019s why their presence doesn\u2019t guarantee that the risk will be minimized. On the contrary, it puts those who participate in them at risk,\u201d he added.\n\nSource: El Universal (sp)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cody Copeland"], "publish_date": "Wed Apr 29 16:18:27 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Authorities and citizens who have restricted access to 340 municipalities are violating the right to free movement, say human rights officials.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Favicon-MND-300x300.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Authorities and citizens who have restricted access to 340 municipalities are violating the right to free movement, say human rights officials.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Municipalities don't have authority to restrict access: feds", "description": "Authorities and citizens who have restricted access to 340 municipalities are violating the right to free movement, say human rights officials.", "url": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/municipalities-dont-have-authority-to-restrict-access-feds/", "site_name": "Mexico News Daily", "image": {"identifier": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/access-1.jpg", "width": 850, "height": 517, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mexiconewsdaily", "published_time": "2020-04-29T16:18:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-11-18T19:13:15+00:00"}, "author": "Cody Copeland", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mexicond", "site": "@mexicond", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Cody Copeland", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-Favicon-MND-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/municipalities-dont-have-authority-to-restrict-access-feds/"}
