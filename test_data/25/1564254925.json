According to the database prepared by Johns Hopkins University, India is now among 44 countries in the world where the number of Covid-19 cases are above 1,000.\n\nTill Tuesday afternoon, India reported more than 1,400 cases of novel coronavirus and over 40 deaths. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had on Monday said 100 people have been cured or discharged. Incidentally, it took 15 days for the number of novel coronavirus cases in India to go from 100 to 1,000. In Turkey, it took only four days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIndia Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) scanned daily situation reports on novel coronavirus published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and found that the speed at which the number of confirmed cases rose from 100 to 1,000 has been relatively slower in India compared to the most affected countries.\n\nDIU divided the data into three categories on the basis of speed at which Covid-19 cases jumped from 100 to 1,000.\n\nCATEGORY 1 - LESS THAN A WEEK\n\nThere was a total of six countries where the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases rose from 100 to 1,000 in less than a week. Covid-19 cases in Turkey jumped from 100 to 1,000 in a matter of four days. On March 19, Turkey crossed the 100-mark, and by March 23, the number of cases had crossed the 1,000-mark.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTurkey is followed by China, the epicentre of the pandemic. In China, the number went from 100 to 1,000 in just five days. On January 19, the country crossed 100 cases, and by January 24, it went above 1,000.\n\nIran too witnessed a jump from 100 to 1,000 cases in five days.\n\nItaly, where the death toll due to Covid-19 is the highest in the world, saw the 100 to 1,000 jump in six days. As of Tuesday afternoon, Italy registered more than 11,000 deaths and over one lakh infections due to the novel coronavirus.\n\nSouth Korea, which has been able to 'flatten the curve' of novel coronavirus witnessed the 100 to 1,000 jump in six days.\n\nEcuador, which crossed the 100-mark on March 19, is the only South American country to have witnessed this jump in six days. At present, Ecuador has more than 1,900 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus.\n\nCATEGORY 2 - SEVEN TO 10 DAYS\n\nMore than half the countries with more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases come under this category.\n\nThere were a total of six countries where the number of novel coronavirus cases jumped from 100 to 1,000 in seven days. Spain, which recently overtook China's tally of Covid-19 cases, had crossed the 100-mark on March 3. By March 10, this number jumped beyond 1,000. As of Tuesday afternoon, Spain registered more than 87,000 cases of novel coronavirus and 7,000 deaths - the second highest in the world after Italy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOther countries that witnessed the 100 to 1,000 jump in seven days include Germany, France, Switzerland, Portugal and Luxembourg. Russia, Brazil and Austria took eight days each to jump from 100 to 1,000 Covid-19 cases.\n\nThere were 13 countries that witnessed the 100 to 1,000 jump in nine days. This includes the United States, which presently has the highest number of positive novel coronavirus cases at more than 1.45 lakh.\n\nOther countries that registered the jump in nine days include the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Israel, Norway, Czechia, Ireland, Denmark, Chile, Pakistan and South Africa.\n\nIn Malaysia and Sweden, this jump took place in 10 days.\n\nCATEGORY 3 - MORE THAN 10 DAYS\n\nThere was a total of 12 countries where the jump in Covid-19 cases from 100 to 1,000 took more than 10 days. Japan, which registered more than 1,900 cases of novel coronavirus as of Tuesday afternoon, took the longest for the jump - at 29 days.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFollowing Japan are India, Greece, Iceland and Finland; these countries took 15 days for the jump. According to WHO reports, India had crossed the 100-mark on March 15 and the 1000-mark on March 30.\n\nThe 100 to 1,000 jump took 14 days in the Philippines; and 12 days in Romania, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. In Australia, Poland and Thailand, this jump took place in 11 days.\n\nInterestingly, most of these countries had announced a complete national lockdown relatively earlier than the countries where the virus is on a rampage.\n\nBarring Australia, all the 10 countries where Covid-19 cases witnessed a slow rise, have less than 2,000 confirmed cases each. Nearly 60 per cent countries in Category 3 have less than 1,500 cases.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) scanned daily situation reports on novel coronavirus published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and found that the speed at which the number of confirmed cases rose from 100 to 1,000 has been relatively slower in India compared to the most affected countries.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.indiatoday.in/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#C04A4A", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0", "description": "India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) scanned daily situation reports on novel coronavirus published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and found that the speed at which the number of confirmed cases rose from 100 to 1,000 has been relatively slower in India compared to the most affected countries.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"data_type": "story", "canonical_identifier": 1661851}}, "og": {"updated_time": "2020-03-31T19:37:24+05:30", "site_name": "India Today", "type": "Article", "title": "India witnessed second slowest 100 to 1,000 jump in Covid-19 cases globally", "description": "India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) scanned daily situation reports on novel coronavirus published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and found that the speed at which the number of confirmed cases rose from 100 to 1,000 has been relatively slower in India compared to the most affected countries.", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/india-second-slowest-100-to-1000-jump-covid19-cases-globally-1661851-2020-03-31", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202003/coronavirus_cases_jum_india.jpeg"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2020-03-31T19:37:24+05:30", "published_time": "2020-03-31T18:53:46+05:30"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "publish-date": "2020-03-31T18:53:46+05:30", "fb": {"pages": 23230437118}, "twitter": {"creator": "@indiatoday", "title": "India witnessed second slowest 100 to 1,000 jump in Covid-19 cases globally", "site": "@indiatoday", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) scanned daily situation reports on novel coronavirus published by the World Health Organization (WHO) and found that the speed at which the number of confirmed cases rose from 100 to 1,000 has been relatively slower in India compared to the most affected countries.", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202003/coronavirus_cases_jum_india.jpeg"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.indiatoday.in/diu/story/india-second-slowest-100-to-1000-jump-covid19-cases-globally-1661851-2020-03-31"}
