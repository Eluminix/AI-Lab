Today, the biggest distributor of Apple Products is reliance and second biggest is HCL Infosystems which then further distributes to iMagine, Uniworld, etc. There are two taxes on Apple Products that get charged. One tax every time a product is sent to distributor and second, everytime a retailer makes a sale. Which makes apple 30-40% more expensive than prices in US, UK and Canada. If FDI in Retail norms are relaxed, products like Surface Pro, Macbook Pro, iPhone, iPad, Google Pixel and Google Pixel Book will be much cheaper. And this is advisable considering India does not manufacture even local class laptops under Indian brand name....", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Apple Store in India", "apple", "Apple CEO", "Apple India", "Tim Cook", "Donald Trump", "Apple Store"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The 1st Apple store in India is set to open in 2021.
