This has resulted in a glut of onions, say traders.\n\nA kilo of onions, even of the best quality, is now trading at the \u20b935 \u2014 \u20b940 levels in the wholesale market, leaving many farmers who hoped to cash in on the shortage unhappy. They are retailing around \u20b940 \u2014 \u20b950.\n\nTraders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase. \u201cThe prices will fall below \u20b920 by the month-end and may even fall below \u20b910 by February-end,\u201d predicted Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onions and Potatoes Traders\u2019 Association.\n\nThis has left the farmers worried. At present, onions from Vijayapura and Chitradurga districts and the Nasik region of Maharashtra are flooding the wholesale markets in the State.\n\n\u201cThe earlier crop suffered massive damage owing to heavy rains. Expecting high prices, farmers \u2014 even those who used to grow maize for a second crop \u2014 started growing onions,\u201d Mr. Kumar explained. More onions are expected to come from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh by February, even as supply from within Karnataka is also expected to go up. This will further lead to crash in prices, traders predict.\n\n\u201cThough the price of onions shot up recently, we did not make much profit, as the yield was very low. Onions had turned wet and were decomposing in the fields itself. What we could sell was very low. But given the prices were started growing them again, only to see the prices crashing in a free fall. It will be tough to bear these losses,\u201d said Basavaraj, a farmer from Vijayapura.\n\nHowever, G. Srinivasan, Director, HOPCOMS, remains optimistic and says that the demand for onions will also increase especially as many households had limited or even stopped purchasing the staple ingredient for a while. \u201cThere will be a stabilisation of prices, but may not crash,\u201d he said\n\nCoconut farmers sustain losses\n\nCoconut farmers, too, are bearing the brunt of the price crash. The price of a quintal of copra (dry coconut) that was in the range of \u20b917,000-\u20b918,000, a few months ago, was trading at \u20b911,500 on Saturday at Tiptur APMC, the prime coconut market in the State. The prices of coconuts have also seen a dip, from over \u20b920 per nut to \u20b917 per nut over the last few days. However, they are still being sold in the range of \u20b925 and \u20b930 in the retail market.\n\nDevraj, a coconut farmer from Tiptur, said the present copra and coconut prices will not fetch them the cultivation cost.\n\n\u201cThe input costs \u2013 diesel, labour and fertilizers \u2013 have gone up. The cost of copra should at least be around \u20b915,000 per quintal if farmers have to recover the cultivation cost. Presently, we are reeling under losses,\u201d he added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["bengaluru", "karnataka", "onion prices", "bengaluru onions", "karnataka onions"], "tags": ["Hindi Belt", "Monkeypox", "Spotlight", "Good Health Hunting", "Live Now", "ISRO", "Decode Karnataka", "Question Corner", "Data Point Podcast", "Karnataka", "Ground Zero", "Live news", "Between Wickets", "Focus Tamil Nadu"], "authors": ["Authors"], "publish_date": "Sun Jan 12 14:40:43 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "From highs of \u20b9200, onion prices crash to the \u20b935-40 range", "description": "Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase", "publish-date": "2020-01-12T20:10:43+05:30", "created-date": "2020-01-12T20:10:43+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-02-06T19:23:59+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-12T14:40:43.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-02-06T13:53:59Z", "section": "Bengaluru", "tag": "karnataka onions", "author": "Staff Reporter"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 61635468, "thg-articleid": 61635468, "thg-articletype": "story", "title": "From highs of \u20b9200, onion prices crash to the \u20b935-40 range", "description": "Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece", "app_name": "The Hindu", "package": "com.mobstac.thehindu"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "Staff Reporter", "title": "From highs of \u20b9200, onion prices crash to the \u20b935-40 range", "description": "Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase", "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/cities/bangalore/qt5wq/article30555011.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/13BGON", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "ipad": "The Hindu", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindu.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "site": "@The_Hindu"}, "keywords": "bengaluru,karnataka,onion prices,bengaluru onions,karnataka onions", "news_keywords": "bengaluru,karnataka,onion prices,bengaluru onions,karnataka onions", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "From highs of \u20b9200, onion prices crash to the \u20b935-40 range", "description": "Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase", "image": {"identifier": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/cities/bangalore/qt5wq/article30555011.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/13BGON", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Hindu"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321, app-argument=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece", "google-signin-client_id": "853251516072-1eudfpp9hhjtjp31fpm8g9fus3ig0ec3.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "jlS-WsOVad-iw4X4xO0EJnHuzr3pK7WqXt3oCy7jpXI", "msvalidate": {"01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2"}, "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece"}
