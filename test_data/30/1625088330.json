This \u201cmay be due to a move to stricter standards and definitions of sustainable investing\u201d in Europe, according to GSIA.\n\nThe second-largest region based on value was the United States, which saw its sustainable assets under management (AUM) grow from $8.7 trillion at the start of 2016 to $12 trillion two years later, marking a rise of 38 percent.\n\nJapan-domiciled sustainable investments quadrupled over the period, rising from just 3 percent of total professionally managed assets in the country to 18 percent to become the largest center for sustainable investing after Europe and the United States.\n\nSustainable investing assets also grew by 42 percent over the two-year period in Canada, where such assets make up half of the country\u2019s overall AUM.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand together represent the region with the greatest proportion of sustainable assets relative to total AUM, at 63 percent.\n\nThe largest sustainable investment strategy globally at the start of 2018 was negative/exclusionary screening at $19.8 trillion, followed by ESG integration ($17.5 trillion) and corporate engagement/shareholder action ($9.8 trillion), the analysis found.\n\n\u201cNegative screening remains the largest strategy in Europe, while ESG integration continues to dominate in the United States, Canada and Australia/New Zealand in asset-weighted terms,\u201d the report states. \u201cCorporate engagement and shareholder action is the dominant strategy in Japan.\u201d\n\nImpact investing, which targets investments aimed at solving social or environmental problems, is a \u201csmall but vibrant segment of the broader sustainable and responsible investing universe\u201d in all of the market studied, added GSIA.\n\nA separate report also released last week by the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN) estimates the current size of the global impact investing market at $502 billion.\n\nBased on collation of AUM data on more than 1,300 impact investors around the world, GIIN claims the market report is the most comprehensive to date, although it concedes that calculating a clear estimate of impact investing\u2019s market size still remains \u201cdifficult\u201d due to the \u201clack of available data and the fast-evolving nature of the industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results of this study underscore the momentum of impact investing, but also the need for continued growth across the responsible investing landscape if we are to address global challenges like those outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said GIIN CEO and co-founder Amit Bouri. \u201cAs the industry grows, we need to be sure it scales with integrity \u2014 ensuring good intentions translate into real impact results.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Finance & Investing", "Investing"], "authors": ["Michael Holder", "Webinar", "Hosted At", "Jim Giles", "Joel Makower", "Tove Malmqvist", "Leah Garden", "Elsa Wenzel"], "publish_date": "Mon Apr  8 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "New reports estimate that asset managers from around the world are significantly expanding their ESG investments.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cropped-trellis_favicon_180x180.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "New reports estimate that asset managers from around the world are significantly expanding their ESG investments.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Global sustainable investing assets surged to $30 trillion in 2018 | Trellis", "description": "New reports estimate that asset managers from around the world are significantly expanding their ESG investments.", "url": "https://trellis.net/article/global-sustainable-investing-assets-surged-30-trillion-2018/", "site_name": "Trellis", "image": {"identifier": "https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/investatstockproductionssstock.jpg", "width": 1470, "height": 894, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/trellis.grp", "published_time": "2019-04-08T00:00:00+00:00"}, "author": "Michael Holder", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@trellisgroup_", "site": "@trellisgroup_", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Michael Holder", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cropped-trellis_favicon_180x180.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://trellis.net/article/global-sustainable-investing-assets-surged-30-trillion-2018/"}
