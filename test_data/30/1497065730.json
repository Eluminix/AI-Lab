The 18th Amendment to the Constitution banned anyone in the US from selling, making, importing or even transporting alcohol.\n\nCriminal gangs immediately took over the industry. Speakeasies sprung up nationwide to sell illegal liquor and tens of millions flouted the legislation.\n\nBy 1933 it had been repealed - the only instance when a constitutional amendment has been overturned in this way.\n\nProhibition is now viewed as a failure. No major political parties or organisations support its return, and there is little public support for such an extreme response in the future.\n\nBut alcohol remains controversial in the US. The drinking age of 21 is higher than in other nations where drinking is legal. Dry counties and dry towns - where alcohol sales are restricted or barred outright - are dotted throughout the country. And Gallup polling from last year shows that nearly one fifth of respondents said drinking alcohol was \"morally wrong\", external.\n\nA century on, a small group of Americans are fighting to keep the dream of the so-called \"noble experiment\" alive.\n\n\"You should think of the Prohibition Party as an exercise in living history,\" says Jim Hedges, treasurer to the party, which is the third-oldest in the US.\n\n\"We're trying to keep the concept alive and the history alive,\" he tells the BBC. \"But as far as getting big enough to have influence, it's not going to happen any time soon.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "US Prohibition was launched on 17 January 1920.
