A male victim was found near the building, and although life-saving measures were attempted by first responders, he died at the scene.\n\nThe victim has been identified as 19-year-old Damien Helmbrecht. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso and the death has been ruled a homicide, according to the King County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office.\n\nCandles, bouquets of flowers, balloons, empty liquor bottles and handwritten notes are now placed at the corner of the community center\u2019s driveway.\n\nTucked in a bundle of pink roses, a handwritten note reads: \u201cMy son, Damien. I miss you my boy. Love always and forever, Mom.\u201d\n\nA motive for the shooting has not been determined, and Federal Way police have not located any suspects.
