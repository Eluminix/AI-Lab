She did not identify Hughes.\n\n\"A man was pronounced deceased after the rocket crashed in the open desert during a rocket launch event,\" she said.\n\nSheriff's aviation investigators were looking into the accident.\n\nIn a statement last year, Discovery, Inc. described the forthcoming show as a look at \"three self-financed teams with sky-high dreams, in their cosmic quest to explore the final frontier on shoe-string budgets.\"\n\nHughes' stunt Saturday was billed as part of a plan to raise money for another project, a planned launch to the border of space on a vehicle described as part rocket, part balloon, Discovery said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe money-raising launch had a goal of reaching 5,000 feet into the sky aboard a \"steam-powered rocket,\" the broadcaster said.\n\nHughes is known both for his homemade rockets and for his belief the earth is flat.\n\nHis desire to prove the planet is \"shaped like a Frisbee\" inspired his vertical endeavors, he has said. But Saturday's launch did not appear to be directly tied to Hughes' flat-earth argument.\n\nIn 2018, he successfully launched himself about 1,875 feet into the sky above the Mojave desert via a garage-made rocket.\n\nHis landing that year was softened when he deployed a parachute. In social media video of Saturday's accident, a parachute-like swath of fabric can be seen flying away from the rocket shortly after blast-off.\n\n\"This thing wants to kill you 10 different ways,\" Hughes said in 2018. \"This thing will kill you in a heartbeat.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Mike Hughes", "rocket launch", "homemade rocket", "Science Channel", "Discovery Inc.", "launch"], "tags": ["Earnings", "ETF report", "Stock market", "Options pit", "FA corner", "Crypto", "Housing", "Economics", "Super Bowl"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "keywords": "Mike Hughes, rocket launch, homemade rocket, Science Channel, Discovery Inc., launch", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "conf": {"cjs": {"consent-flow": "yguce", "locale": "en-US"}}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@YahooNews", "creator": "@YahooNews", "title": "Daredevil 'Mad' Mike Hughes dies in homemade rocket launch", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cyR_YeUPIOf4JsEWX769LQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/19787108b1449426db50bde732c6dd0d"}, "og": {"title": "Daredevil 'Mad' Mike Hughes dies in homemade rocket launch", "description": "He was working on a TV show, \"Homemade Astronauts,\" when his craft crashed in the California desert.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/daredevil-mad-mike-hughes-dies-051000808.html", "site_name": "Yahoo News", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cyR_YeUPIOf4JsEWX769LQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbc_news_122/19787108b1449426db50bde732c6dd0d", "height": 800, "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b66fda9-4999-306a-93f2-91d1df4f2ec7&src=web"}, "android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b66fda9-4999-306a-93f2-91d1df4f2ec7&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/daredevil-mad-mike-hughes-dies-051000808.html"}
