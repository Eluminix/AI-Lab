Seen by many as Merkel's would-be successor, Kramp-Karrenbauer is struggling to assert her control over the conservative party after the Thuringia branch defied her and sided with the AfD.\n\n(Reporting by Andreas Rinke, Holger Hansen, Christoph Steitz and Joseph Nasr; Editing by Christina Fincher)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Chancellor Angela Merkel", "Thuringia", "Christian Democrats", "CDU", "state premier", "Thomas Kemmerich", "Christian Social Union", "Germany"], "tags": ["Earnings", "ETF report", "Stock market", "Options pit", "FA corner", "Crypto", "Housing", "Economics", "Super Bowl"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's ruling coalition on Saturday called for fresh elections in the eastern state of Thuringia, whose pro-business premier stepped down only two days after being helped into the job with votes from the far right.
