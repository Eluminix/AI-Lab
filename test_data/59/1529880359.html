Christopher Cai and colleagues at three University of California campuses examined 22 studies on the projected cost impact for single-payer health insurance in the United States and reported their findings in a recent paper in PLOS Medicine. Every single study predicted that it would yield net savings over several years. In fact, it's the only way to rein in health care spending significantly in the U.S. All of the studies, regardless of ideological orientation, showed that long-term cost savings were likely. Even the Mercatus Center, a right-wing think tank, recently found about $2 trillion in net savings over 10 years from a single-payer Medicare for All system. Most importantly, everyone in America would have high-quality health care coverage. Medicare for All is far less costly than our current system largely because it reduces administrative costs. With one public plan negotiating rates with health care providers, billing becomes quite simple. We do away with three-quarters of the estimated $812 billion the U.S. now spends on health care administration. Administrative costs are so high because thousands of insurance companies individually negotiate benefit rules and rates with thousands of hospitals and doctors. On top of that, they rely on different billing procedures - and this puts a costly burden on providers. Administrative savings from Medicare for All would be about $600 billion a year. Savings on prescription drugs would be between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, if we paid around the same price as other wealthy countries pay for their drugs. A Medicare for All system would save still more with implementation of global health care spending budgets. Even more savings are possible in a Medicare for All system because, like every other wealthy country, we would have a uniform electronic health records system. Such a system generates additional savings because system problems would be easier to detect and correct. A uniform claims data system helps reduce health care spending for fraudulent services. In 2018, total US health care costs were $3.6 trillion, representing 17.7 percent of GDP. Savings are in part a function of the benefits Medicare for All covers. The Mercatus report and others projected savings, even with the elimination of deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Under both Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) Medicare for All bill and Rep. Pramila Jayapal's (D-Wash.) Medicare for All bill, patients would not pay deductibles or coinsurance when they receive medical care. Their bills also provide for vision, hearing and dental care, as well as long-term services and supports, such as home care and nursing home care. No matter how you design a single-payer public health insurance system, it would have lower overall health care costs, so long as for-profit private health insurers no longer exist to drive up health care costs. Yes, it's true that some other wealthy countries rely on \"private insurers\" to provide benefits and spend far less than we do on care. But, these insurers do not operate in any way like health insurers in the U.S. Other wealthy countries dictate virtually every element of the health insurance people receive, including what's covered, what's paid, and people's out-of-pocket costs--all identical for everyone. The insurers operate like claims processors or bill payers. They follow the coverage and payment rules set by the government, nothing like the private health insurers in the U.S. which revel in product diversity (read: complexity and confusion). And, if you're thinking that having the federal government guarantee coverage to all Americans is a big deal, it's actually not. The government already pays for about two-thirds of health care costs. Among other things, it pays for Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TriCare, and a wide range of state and local health care programs, along with private insurance for government employees and tax subsidies for private insurance. Whether you call it single-payer or Medicare for All, it isn't some socialist pipe dream. It's a sensible, efficient, and effective way to guarantee excellent health insurance to everyone.","author":{"@type":"Person","description":"Diane Archer is president of Just Care USA, an independent digital hub covering health and financial issues facing boomers and their families and promoting policy solutions.

Every single study predicted that it would yield net savings over several years. In fact, it&#39;s the only way to rein in health care spending significantly in the U.S.</p><p>All of the studies, regardless of ideological orientation, showed that long-term cost savings were likely. Even the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf">Mercatus Center</a>, a right-wing think tank, recently found about $2 trillion in net savings over 10 years from a single-payer Medicare for All system. Most importantly, everyone in America would have high-quality health care coverage.</p><p>Medicare for All is far less costly than our current system largely because it reduces administrative costs. With one public plan negotiating rates with health care providers, billing becomes quite simple. We do away with three-quarters of the estimated $812 billion the U.S. now spends on health care administration.</p><p>Administrative costs are so high because thousands of insurance companies individually negotiate benefit rules and rates with thousands of hospitals and doctors. On top of that, they rely on different billing procedures - and this puts a costly burden on providers.</p><p>Administrative savings from Medicare for All would be about <a href="https://justcareusa.org/medicare-for-all-would-save-600-billion-a-year-in-administrative-costs/">$600 billion</a> a year. Savings on prescription drugs would be between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, if we paid around the same price as other wealthy countries pay for their drugs. A Medicare for All system would save still more with implementation of <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20191205.239679/full/">global health care spending budgets</a>.</p><p>Even more savings are possible in a Medicare for All system because, like every other wealthy country, we would have a uniform electronic health records system. Such a system generates additional savings because system problems would be easier to detect and correct. A uniform claims data system helps reduce health care spending for fraudulent services. In 2018, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/12/05/u-s-health-spending-rose-to-3-6-trillion-in-2018-propelled-by-health-insurance-tax/">total US health care costs were $3.6 trillion</a>, representing 17.7 percent of GDP.</p><p>Savings are in part a function of the benefits Medicare for All covers. The Mercatus report and others projected savings, even with the elimination of deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Under both Sen. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>&#39; (I-Vt.) <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-2019-summary">Medicare for All bill</a> and Rep. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/pramila-jayapal">Pramila Jayapal</a>&#39;s (D-Wash.) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384">Medicare for All bill</a>, patients would not pay deductibles or coinsurance when they receive medical care. Their bills also provide for vision, hearing and dental care, as well as long-term services and supports, such as home care and nursing home care.</p><p>No matter how you design a single-payer public health insurance system, it would have lower overall health care costs, so long as for-profit private health insurers no longer exist to drive up health care costs. Yes, it&#39;s true that some other wealthy countries rely on &quot;private insurers&quot; to provide benefits and spend far less than we do on care. But, these insurers do not operate in any way like health insurers in the U.S.</p><p>Other wealthy countries dictate virtually every element of the health insurance people receive, including what&#39;s covered, what&#39;s paid, and people&#39;s out-of-pocket costs--all identical for everyone. The insurers operate like claims processors or bill payers. They follow the coverage and payment rules set by the government, nothing like the private health insurers in the U.S. which revel in product diversity (read: complexity and confusion).</p><p>And, if you&#39;re thinking that having the federal government guarantee coverage to all Americans is a big deal, it&#39;s actually not. The government already pays for about two-thirds of health care costs. Among other things, it pays for Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TriCare, and a wide range of state and local health care programs, along with private insurance for government employees and tax subsidies for private insurance.</p><p>Whether you call it single-payer or Medicare for All, it isn&#39;t some socialist pipe dream.

Every single study predicted that it would yield net savings over several years. In fact, it&#39;s the only way to rein in health care spending significantly in the U.S.</p><p>All of the studies, regardless of ideological orientation, showed that long-term cost savings were likely. Even the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf">Mercatus Center</a>, a right-wing think tank, recently found about $2 trillion in net savings over 10 years from a single-payer Medicare for All system. Most importantly, everyone in America would have high-quality health care coverage.</p><p>Medicare for All is far less costly than our current system largely because it reduces administrative costs. With one public plan negotiating rates with health care providers, billing becomes quite simple. We do away with three-quarters of the estimated $812 billion the U.S. now spends on health care administration.</p><p>Administrative costs are so high because thousands of insurance companies individually negotiate benefit rules and rates with thousands of hospitals and doctors. On top of that, they rely on different billing procedures - and this puts a costly burden on providers.</p><p>Administrative savings from Medicare for All would be about <a href="https://justcareusa.org/medicare-for-all-would-save-600-billion-a-year-in-administrative-costs/">$600 billion</a> a year. Savings on prescription drugs would be between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, if we paid around the same price as other wealthy countries pay for their drugs. A Medicare for All system would save still more with implementation of <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20191205.239679/full/">global health care spending budgets</a>.</p><p>Even more savings are possible in a Medicare for All system because, like every other wealthy country, we would have a uniform electronic health records system. Such a system generates additional savings because system problems would be easier to detect and correct. A uniform claims data system helps reduce health care spending for fraudulent services. In 2018, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/12/05/u-s-health-spending-rose-to-3-6-trillion-in-2018-propelled-by-health-insurance-tax/">total US health care costs were $3.6 trillion</a>, representing 17.7 percent of GDP.</p><p>Savings are in part a function of the benefits Medicare for All covers. The Mercatus report and others projected savings, even with the elimination of deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Under both Sen. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>&#39; (I-Vt.) <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-2019-summary">Medicare for All bill</a> and Rep. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/pramila-jayapal">Pramila Jayapal</a>&#39;s (D-Wash.) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384">Medicare for All bill</a>, patients would not pay deductibles or coinsurance when they receive medical care. Their bills also provide for vision, hearing and dental care, as well as long-term services and supports, such as home care and nursing home care.</p><p>No matter how you design a single-payer public health insurance system, it would have lower overall health care costs, so long as for-profit private health insurers no longer exist to drive up health care costs. Yes, it&#39;s true that some other wealthy countries rely on &quot;private insurers&quot; to provide benefits and spend far less than we do on care. But, these insurers do not operate in any way like health insurers in the U.S.</p><p>Other wealthy countries dictate virtually every element of the health insurance people receive, including what&#39;s covered, what&#39;s paid, and people&#39;s out-of-pocket costs--all identical for everyone. The insurers operate like claims processors or bill payers. They follow the coverage and payment rules set by the government, nothing like the private health insurers in the U.S. which revel in product diversity (read: complexity and confusion).</p><p>And, if you&#39;re thinking that having the federal government guarantee coverage to all Americans is a big deal, it&#39;s actually not. The government already pays for about two-thirds of health care costs. Among other things, it pays for Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TriCare, and a wide range of state and local health care programs, along with private insurance for government employees and tax subsidies for private insurance.</p><p>Whether you call it single-payer or Medicare for All, it isn&#39;t some socialist pipe dream. It&#39;s a sensible, efficient, and effective way to guarantee excellent health insurance to everyone.</p><div class="around-the-web"></div></div></div><span class="" data-elid="2658849671" data-post-url="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" data-authors="Diane Archer" data-headline="Here&#39;s What 22 Separate Studies Found: Medicare for All Would Cost Less Than the For-Profit Status Quo" data-page-title="22 Studies: Medicare for All Cheaper Than For-Profit Model | Common Dreams"></span></div></div></div><script type="application/json" id="post-context-2658849671" class="post-context post-context-2658849671">

Every single study predicted that it would yield net savings over several years. In fact, it&#39;s the only way to rein in health care spending significantly in the U.S.</p><p>All of the studies, regardless of ideological orientation, showed that long-term cost savings were likely. Even the <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf">Mercatus Center</a>, a right-wing think tank, recently found about $2 trillion in net savings over 10 years from a single-payer Medicare for All system. Most importantly, everyone in America would have high-quality health care coverage.</p><p>Medicare for All is far less costly than our current system largely because it reduces administrative costs. With one public plan negotiating rates with health care providers, billing becomes quite simple. We do away with three-quarters of the estimated $812 billion the U.S. now spends on health care administration.</p><p>Administrative costs are so high because thousands of insurance companies individually negotiate benefit rules and rates with thousands of hospitals and doctors. On top of that, they rely on different billing procedures - and this puts a costly burden on providers.</p><p>Administrative savings from Medicare for All would be about <a href="https://justcareusa.org/medicare-for-all-would-save-600-billion-a-year-in-administrative-costs/">$600 billion</a> a year. Savings on prescription drugs would be between $200 billion and $300 billion a year, if we paid around the same price as other wealthy countries pay for their drugs. A Medicare for All system would save still more with implementation of <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20191205.239679/full/">global health care spending budgets</a>.</p><p>Even more savings are possible in a Medicare for All system because, like every other wealthy country, we would have a uniform electronic health records system. Such a system generates additional savings because system problems would be easier to detect and correct. A uniform claims data system helps reduce health care spending for fraudulent services. In 2018, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/12/05/u-s-health-spending-rose-to-3-6-trillion-in-2018-propelled-by-health-insurance-tax/">total US health care costs were $3.6 trillion</a>, representing 17.7 percent of GDP.</p><p>Savings are in part a function of the benefits Medicare for All covers. The Mercatus report and others projected savings, even with the elimination of deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Under both Sen. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>&#39; (I-Vt.) <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/download/medicare-for-all-2019-summary">Medicare for All bill</a> and Rep. <a class="rollover-people-link" href="https://thehill.com/people/pramila-jayapal">Pramila Jayapal</a>&#39;s (D-Wash.) <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1384">Medicare for All bill</a>, patients would not pay deductibles or coinsurance when they receive medical care. Their bills also provide for vision, hearing and dental care, as well as long-term services and supports, such as home care and nursing home care.</p><p>No matter how you design a single-payer public health insurance system, it would have lower overall health care costs, so long as for-profit private health insurers no longer exist to drive up health care costs. Yes, it&#39;s true that some other wealthy countries rely on &quot;private insurers&quot; to provide benefits and spend far less than we do on care. But, these insurers do not operate in any way like health insurers in the U.S.</p><p>Other wealthy countries dictate virtually every element of the health insurance people receive, including what&#39;s covered, what&#39;s paid, and people&#39;s out-of-pocket costs--all identical for everyone. The insurers operate like claims processors or bill payers. They follow the coverage and payment rules set by the government, nothing like the private health insurers in the U.S. which revel in product diversity (read: complexity and confusion).</p><p>And, if you&#39;re thinking that having the federal government guarantee coverage to all Americans is a big deal, it&#39;s actually not. The government already pays for about two-thirds of health care costs. Among other things, it pays for Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TriCare, and a wide range of state and local health care programs, along with private insurance for government employees and tax subsidies for private insurance.</p><p>Whether you call it single-payer or Medicare for All, it isn&#39;t some socialist pipe dream. It&#39;s a sensible, efficient, and effective way to guarantee excellent health insurance to everyone.</p><div class="around-the-web"></div></div></div><span class="" data-elid="2658849671" data-post-url="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" data-authors="Diane Archer" data-headline="Here&#39;s What 22 Separate Studies Found: Medicare for All Would Cost Less Than the For-Profit Status Quo" data-page-title="22 Studies: Medicare for All Cheaper Than For-Profit Model | Common Dreams"></span><div class="tags"><a class="tags__item" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/bernie-sanders">bernie sanders</a><a class="tags__item" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/elizabeth-warren">elizabeth warren</a><a class="tags__item" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/healthcare">healthcare</a><a class="tags__item" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/medicare-for-all">medicare for all</a><a class="tags__item" href="https://www.commondreams.org/tag/single-payer">single-payer</a></div><div class="widget__shares share-panel"><!-- TWITTER --><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo&text=Here%27s%20What%2022%20Separate%20Studies%20Found%3A%20Medicare%20for%20All%20Would%20Cost%20Less%20Than%20the%20For-Profit%20Status%20Quo&" target="_blank" data-track-share="Twitter" class="share share-popup share-tw" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share on Twitter"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icons-share tw fa fa-twitter"></i></a><!-- FLIPBOARD --><a href="https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" target="_blank" class="share share-popup share-flipboard" data-track-share="Flipboard" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share on Flipboard"><svg aria-hidden="true" style="border-radius:45%" aria-hidden="true" role="img" viewbox="15 40 430 430"><path fill="currentColor" d="M0 32v448h448V32H0zm358.4 179.2h-89.6v89.6h-89.6v89.6H89.6V121.6h268.8v89.6z"></path></svg></a><!-- REDDIT --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" target="_blank" data-track-share="Reddit" class="share share-popup share-reddit" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share on Reddit"><i aria-hidden="true" class="icons-share rd fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a><!-- COPY LINK --><a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" data-clipboard-text="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/02/24/heres-what-22-separate-studies-found-medicare-all-would-cost-less-profit-status-quo" class="share share-copy-link" title="Copy this link to clipboard"><i class="icons-share" style="width: 60%"><svg aria-hidden="true" data-prefix="far" data-icon="copy" class="svg-inline--fa fa-copy fa-w-14" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512"><path fill="currentColor" d="M433.941 65.941l-51.882-51.882A48 48 0 0 0 348.118 0H176c-26.51 0-48 21.49-48 48v48H48c-26.51 0-48 21.49-48 48v320c0 26.51 21.49 48 48 48h224c26.51 0 48-21.49 48-48v-48h80c26.51 0 48-21.49 48-48V99.882a48 48 0 0 0-14.059-33.941zM266 464H54a6 6 0 0 1-6-6V150a6 6 0 0 1 6-6h74v224c0 26.51 21.49 48 48 48h96v42a6 6 0 0 1-6 6zm128-96H182a6 6 0 0 1-6-6V54a6 6 0 0 1 6-6h106v88c0 13.255 10.745 24 24 24h88v202a6 6 0 0 1-6 6zm6-256h-64V48h9.632c1.591 0 3.117.632 4.243 1.757l48.368 48.368a6 6 0 0 1 1.757 4.243V112z"></path></svg></i></a></div></div></div></div><script type="application/json" id="post-context-2658849671" class="post-context post-context-2658849671">
