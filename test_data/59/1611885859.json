distributed \u20ac100 million among the autonomous communities in the fight against gender violence.\n\nThe funds, of which Andalucia will receive \u20ac15.28 million, have been distributed according to the criteria agreed upon by the Government and the communities at the Conference on Equality.\n\nAndalucia, which will also receive three credits from the Government worth \u20ac9.5 million, is the community that will receive the most funds in 2020.\n\nOther communities to receive funding include: Catalunya (12.83 million), Madrid (10.5 million), Valencia (8.76 million), Galicia (7.94 million) and Castile y Leon (7.43 million).\n\n\n\nThey were followed by Castilla-La Mancha (6.24 million), the Canary Islands (5.92 million), Aragon (4.65 million), Extremadura (4.61 million), the Balearic Islands (4.14 million), Murcia (3.41 million), Asturias (2.87 million), Cantabria (1.55 million), La Rioja (1.5 million) and Ceuta and Melilla (1.15 million each).\n\nThe distribution of the \u20ac100 million has taken into account the distribution of women throughout the national territory.\n\nExperts warn that gender violence could see a rise due to coronavirus lockdown.\n\nThe funds must be allocated to the maintenance and improvement of resource networks and social services for the care of victims, with special attention to women in vulnerable situations.\n\nThe budget is also aimed to help with social and occupational integration, promote awareness and prevention campaigns as well as support services for minors and children.\n\nThe autonomous communities must present a final report on the projects or programmes promoted with the funds received for the development of the State Pact against Gender Violence before March 31, 2021.\n\nLast year saw the number of gender violence convictions in Spain reach an all time high with 51,790 cases taken to court, of which 36,534 resulted in convictions and 15,256 in acquittals.\n\nUnfortunately, 2020 is likely to see another raise in the numbers as experts warn that gender violence could see a rise due to coronavirus lockdown.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["news spain", "Lead", "Andalucia", "newspaper",
