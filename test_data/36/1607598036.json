measures that have been in place for the last two weeks, people are starting to drive around again.\n\nAccording to El Espanol, Sevilla is the city with the highest increase in car usage, with its levels reaching 59% of what they were before the coronavirus crisis.\n\nValencia follows in second place on 58%.\n\nIn comparison, the use of public transport is still below 30% of the levels it was prior to the pandemic, with Valencia being the only city reaching levels above one third, at 34%.\n\nThat\u2019s followed by Bilbao on 29%.\n\nWalking levels in cities are even slower to recover, with Madrid only registering 9% of the levels they were before.\n\nThis data provided by El Espanol shows how people in Spain have chosen their cars as their preferred use of transport following the first
