Thanks in part to Hill\u2019s performance as Donnie Azoff, Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d tops the list with 715 expletives.\n\nAdam Sandler\u2019s 2019 drama \u201cUncut Gems\u201d comes in second place with 646 swear words, and Scorsese\u2019s other crime thriller \u201cCasino\u201d is third with 606 swears. When it comes to the most expletives per 1,000 words, Gary Oldman\u2019s 1997 drama \u201cNil by Mouth\u201d is victorious, with 41.3 curses per 1,000 words.\n\nAccording to the study, Hill has spewed 376 swear words throughout his career, barely beating his \u201cWolf of Wall Street\u201d co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, who has amassed 361 curses. The rest of the list includes Samuel L. Jackson, Sandler, Al Pacino, Denzel Washington, Billy Bob Thornton, Seth Rogen, Bradley Cooper and Danny McBride.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDiCaprio\u2019s Jordan Belfort, the star of \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d ranks as the \u201csweariest\u201d film character with 332 swears in the three-hour movie. Hill\u2019s supporting character Azoff has the highest rate of curse words of any character, totaling 74 swears per 1,000 words.\n\nIn a joking Instagram post, Hill thanked Scorsese for \u201cpushing me over the edge\u201d and gave a shoutout to Jackson, a longtime f-bomb dropper in films. Jackson\u2019s \u201cJackie Brown\u201d character Ordell Robbie came in as the fifth highest swearer.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jordan Moreau", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "publish_date": "Sat May 16 21:47:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Thanks to his foul-mouthed roles in \"Superbad\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Jonah Hill swears the most of any film actor, a study shows.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/icons/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Thanks to his foul-mouthed roles in \"Superbad\" and \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" Jonah Hill swears the most of any film actor, a study shows.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "author": "Jordan Moreau", "tags": "Jonah Hill, Leonardo Dicaprio, Samuel L.
