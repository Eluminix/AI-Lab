sector\u2019s \u2018lack of profits\u2019.\n\nAccording to the Asaja, COAG and UPA unions, the protests will occur across 11 regions starting from today.\n\nThis week will see demonstrations and protests in Galicia, Aragon, Castile and Leon, La Rioja, Extremadura, Andalucia and the Basque Country.\n\nMeanwhile next week farmers and ranchers will strike in Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Madrid and Murcia.\n\nUsing the slogan \u2018In defence of their future\u2019, the protests are intended to \u2018denounce the serious lack of profitability\u2019 and attacks facing the agricultural industry.\n\nOrganisers have blasted \u2018low prices at origin\u2019 and the increase in production costs, including the recent rise in minimum wage.\n\nThese measures are only being made worse by trade restrictions arising from Brexit and the US trade tariffs being pursued by Donald Trump, the unions claim.\n\nThe sector said it wants to be compensated for the damages suffered and to have \u2018support measures\u2019 implemented.\n\nThe unions also said it hopes the government becomes aware of the seriousness of climate change and the depopulation of rural Spain.\n\nThe protests will begin tomorrow in front of the Galician Parliament in Santiago de Compostela.\n\nOn Wednesday a rally will be held at the gates of the Agroexpo fair, in Don Benito (Badajoz), another in Logro\u00f1o in front of the Government Delegation and one more in the Port of Almeria.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["news spain", "Lead", "newspaper", "The Olive Press", "Business &
