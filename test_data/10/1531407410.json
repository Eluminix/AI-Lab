Investors are set to book a basic loss per share of 83.3p, far down from 2018\u2019s 5.95p earning per share.\n\n\n\nThe business also warned it is reviewing its 2018 balance sheet to reclassify a \u00a32.6m accrual as a liability and a \u00a310m loan as a liability.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeither reclassification has any impact on the statement of comprehensive income or total shareholder funds as reported in the prior year,\u201d McColl\u2019s said.\n\n\n\nThe retailer trimmed net debt from \u00a398.6m in 2018 to \u00a394.1m.\n\n\u201cWe have stabilised the business and refocused on retail execution in 2019, in line with our key priorities for the year,\u201d chief executive Jonathan Miller said.\n\n\u201cAgainst challenging trading conditions we have made good operational progress, whilst reducing debt and making appropriate levels of investment.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to FY20, we are embarking on a strategic change programme, refining our model and better tailoring our offer to the customers and communities we serve, using the learnings to build the foundations for future growth.\u201d\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Joe Curtis", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 26 07:49:35 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Convenience store McColl\u2019s sank to a huge \u00a3100m loss in 2019, it revealed today as it warned investors it will cancel their dividend.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/app_launcher_icon_final_rounded.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Convenience store McColl\u2019s sank to a huge \u00a3100m loss in 2019, it revealed today as it warned investors it will cancel their dividend.", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "McColl's suspends dividend as it swings to \u00a3100m loss", "description": "Convenience store McColl\u2019s sank to a huge \u00a3100m loss in 2019, it revealed today as it warned investors it will cancel their dividend.", "url": "https://www.cityam.com/mccolls-suspends-dividend-as-it-swings-to-100m-loss/", "site_name": "City AM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mccolls-store-front-1-5b8e43cd922f1.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 667, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cityam", "published_time": "2020-02-26T07:49:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-26T07:49:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cityam", "site": "@cityam", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Joe Curtis"}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100|ver:3.2.2|site:18445|widget:1|disable_video_autosave:0|channels:Array|width:16|height:9|autoplay:0|aspect:1|user_id:17159|default_channel:18|ovr_def:1|async_embed:1|google_seo:1|raw_embed:0|unit:16444|unit_width:480|unit_height:270|player:24372|video_image:|onready:|disable_shortcode:0|hide_upload_video:0|hide_add_video:0|hide_yt_video:0|hide_manage_outstream:0|hide_manage_carousels:0|hide_manage_playlist:0|default_exchange_rule:0", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/app_launcher_icon_final_rounded.png?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.cityam.com/mccolls-suspends-dividend-as-it-swings-to-100m-loss/"}
