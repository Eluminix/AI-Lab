Workers at factories are in the same situation,\u201d he added.\n\nSome North Korean traders and workers in China are concerned about how they will survive without an income while restaurants and factories remain closed and trade across the Sino-North Korean border remains suspended, Daily NK sources said.\n\nA source in North Pyongan Province told Daily NK that some of the workers\u2019 parents who live in Pyongyang are so worried that their confined children are starving they have been sending money through Chinese traders to help them through this difficult time.\n\nCHINA SHUTDOWN\n\nChinese authorities have extended the vacation period for Chinese Lunar New Year\u2019s until Feb. 9 to prevent people from travelling around, and this has led most factories in the country to close their doors.\n\nChinese public servants will start working again from Feb. 9 and the factories will start operating again on Feb. 10, sources in China told Daily NK.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean workers will also likely start working from Feb. 10 if everything goes to plan,\u201d one source added.\n\nLocal governments in Shenyang and Dalian, however, have ordered Chinese people who traveled outside of their home provinces during the Chinese Lunar New Year\u2019s holiday to stay in their houses for two weeks. This suggests that factories in the country may stay shuttered for much longer than anticipated.\n\nPAY UP, OR ELSE\n\nNorth Korean traders and workers in China also told Daily NK they will have difficulty contributing to the North Korean regime\u2019s \u201cloyalty fund\u201d given the shutdown of factories in China.\n\nDaily NK previously reported [article in Korean] that North Korean authorities had ordered workers abroad to send all their money for the loyalty fund during the Lunar New Year\u2019s holiday.\n\n\u201cNorth Korean authorities ordered us send our share of the loyalty fund for the first quarter of the year by the end of January. I sent [some of the] money, but then suddenly the restaurants and factories [in China] closed because of the coronavirus,\u201d a North Korean trader in China told Daily NK.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way of getting more money [in this situation], and I think it will be difficult for me to send the rest of the money for the loyalty fund on time,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTraders can\u2019t use the coronavirus as an excuse for failing to send the money\u2026[and] are already fearing the thought of heading back to Pyongyang.\u201d\n\nPlease direct any comments or questions about this article to dailynkenglish@uni-media.net.\n\nRead in Korean", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["pyongyang", "factories", "dalian", "lunar new year's", "liaoning province", "restaurants", "ministry of foreign affairs", "foreign currency-earning", "sino-north korean border", "jilin province", "coronavirus"], "authors": ["Mun Dong Hui", "Mun Dong Hui Is One Of Daily Nk'S Full-Time Reporters", "Covers North Korean Technology", "Human Rights Issues", "Including The Country'S Political Prison Camp System.
