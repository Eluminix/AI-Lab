Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) told Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) during their private meeting in 2018. She says he told her a woman couldn't win the presidency. He says otherwise. Either way, it's becoming increasingly evident that at least one woman\u2014Liz Warren\u2014cannot win in 2020.\n\nA Morning Consult poll published Tuesday painted a bleak picture for Warren. Among Democratic voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina, the embattled Massachusetts senator placed fourth, polling at 11 percent. Tom Steyer, one of two white male billionaires in the race, was in third place at 17 percent, presumably thanks to the massive amounts of money he has spent on advertising in those early primary states.\n\nThe same poll showed Warren in a distant third among Democratic voters nationwide. Warren, at 14 percent, trailed Sanders (23 percent) and former vice president Joe Biden (29 percent). Most alarmingly, she only barely led former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg (12 percent), the other white male billionaire running in the Democratic primary.\n\nThat's not all. Warren also performed worse in a hypothetical contest against President Donald Trump than did other Democratic candidates. The poll found Warren tied with Trump at 43 percent among registered voters. Trump received just 41 percent in hypothetical matchups against Biden (47 percent), Sanders (46 percent), Bloomberg (45 percent), and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg (43 percent).\n\nOh, and it turns out the New York Times's stupid double endorsement of Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) had precisely zero impact on Warren's standing in the race. In fact, the biggest post-endorsement change among Democratic voters who read the Times was a five-point increase in support for Joe Biden.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Democratic Party", "Iowa", "2020 Election", "Elizabeth Warren", "New Hampshire", "Tom Steyer"], "authors": ["Andrew Stiles", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "publish_date": "Tue Jan 28 18:05:30 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "We'll probably never know exactly what Sen.
