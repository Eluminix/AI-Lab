Nagar, have made a request to the Greater Chennai Corporation to re-locate a trash\n\ndisposal point, located on Guild Street, T. Nagar. Residents say the disposal point is nothing short of a trash\n\nyard. Though, steps are taken to clear the garbage every day, either in the night or early in the morning, the\n\nconservancy staff collect and dispose the trash from residential apartments and homes and other commercial\n\nestablishments in the vicinity for the conservancy truck staff to clear the garbage.\n\nOn days, the garbage is spilled on to the roads affecting free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. To add to\n\nthe woes of the pedestrians, especially women, men relieve themselves in the open. Of late, the space near\n\nthe trash yard has become a parking slot.\n\n\u201cIn the mornings and evenings, countless number of pedestrians walk through the stretch to reach the railway\n\nterminal and a couple of educational institutions. Stray dogs roam in large numbers on the stretch, creating a\n\nfear in the minds of the pedestrians. We have complained several times in this regard to the authorities\n\nconcerned in the GCC to re-locate the dumping point. But, no action, has been taken till date. We are being\n\nasked by the authorities concerned to re-locate a trash disposal point,\" residents say.\n\nBesides, while clearing the trash from the disposal point, the walls of a prestigious educational institution\n\nlocated on the stretch have been damaged by the conservancy vehicle for fifth time in a row. A similar\n\nsituation prevails on Police Quarters Road.\n\nDespite, a washroom near the T. Nagar bus terminus, men relive in the open on the stretch, making it horrible to commute through the stretch to gain access to bus terminus, residents, add.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Hindi Belt", "Monkeypox", "Spotlight", "Good Health Hunting", "Live Now", "ISRO", "Decode Karnataka", "Question Corner", "Data Point Podcast", "Live news", "Ground Zero", "Between Wickets", "Focus Tamil Nadu"], "authors": ["Authors"], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 18 12:58:04 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Chennai News:Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "description": "Chennai News:Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "publish-date": "2020-01-18T18:28:04+05:30", "created-date": "2020-01-18T18:28:04+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-01-18T18:28:04+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-18T12:58:04.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-18T12:58:04Z", "section": "Chennai", "author": "T S Atul Swaminathan"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 59779240, "thg-articleid": 59779240, "thg-articletype": "editorial", "title": "Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "description": "Plea to re-locate the dump yard"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-re-locate-the-dump-yard/article30594296.ece", "app_name": "The Hindu", "package": "com.mobstac.thehindu"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "T S Atul Swaminathan", "title": "Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "description": "Chennai News:Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "ipad": "The Hindu", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindu.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "site": "@The_Hindu"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "description": "Chennai News:Plea to re-locate the dump yard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-re-locate-the-dump-yard/article30594296.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Hindu"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321, app-argument=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-re-locate-the-dump-yard/article30594296.ece", "google-signin-client_id": "853251516072-1eudfpp9hhjtjp31fpm8g9fus3ig0ec3.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "jlS-WsOVad-iw4X4xO0EJnHuzr3pK7WqXt3oCy7jpXI", "msvalidate": {"01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2"}, "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plea-to-re-locate-the-dump-yard/article30594296.ece"}
