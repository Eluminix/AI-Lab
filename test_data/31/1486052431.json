PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nHONG KONG/KUALA LUMPUR (AP, THE STAR/ASIA NEW NETWORK) - Hong Kong authorities activated a newly created \"serious response\" level on Saturday (Jan 4) as fears spread about a mysterious infectious disease that may have been brought back by visitors to a mainland Chinese city.\n\nFive possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan, an inland city west of Shanghai and about 900km north of Hong Kong.\n\nThe outbreak, which emerged last month, has revived memories of the 2002-2003 Sars epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere.\n\nThe serious response level indicates a moderate impact on Hong Kong's population of 7.5 million people. It is the second highest in a three-tier system that is part of a new government plan launched on Saturday to respond to infectious diseases of unknown cause.\n\nThe city's health department added an additional thermal imaging system at Hong Kong's airport on Friday to check the body temperature of arriving passengers. More staff have been assigned for temperature checks at the West Kowloon high-speed rail station that connects Hong Kong to the mainland.\n\nCountries, such as Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam, are also carrying out temperature screening on passengers arriving from Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province.\n\nHong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on a visit to the West Kowloon train station on Friday to review the health surveillance measures, urged any travellers who develop respiratory symptoms to wear surgical masks, seek medical attention and let doctors know where they have been.\n\nThe Wuhan health commission said 11 of the 44 people diagnosed with the pneumonia were in critical condition as of Friday. All were being treated in isolation and 121 others who had been in close contact with them were under observation.\n\nMost of the cases have been traced to the South China Seafood City food market in the suburbs of sprawling Wuhan, where offerings reportedly include wild animals that can carry viruses dangerous to humans. The commission said the market has been disinfected.\n\nThe most common symptom has been fever, with shortness of breath and lung infections in a small number of cases, the commission said. There have been no clear indications of human-to-human transmission of the disease.\n\nThe latest cases in Hong Kong are two women, aged 12 and 41, who had been to Wuhan in the past 14 days but did not appear to have visited the food market, the Hospital Authority said. They were in stable condition and being treated in isolation at Princess Margaret Hospital.\n\nBesides Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, Hong Kong has also been hit by bird flu in 1997 and swine flu in 2009.\n\nJoin ST's Telegram channel and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Hong Kong", "China", "Diseases"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sat Jan  4 10:57:26 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Five possible cases have been reported of a viral pneumonia that has also infected at least 44 people in Wuhan.
