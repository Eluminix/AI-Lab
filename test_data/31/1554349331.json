The sex workers were asked not to allow any visitor until April 5,\u00bb local police chief Ashiqur Rahman told EFE.\n\nAshiqur said the police has requested that the administration allocate about 32 metric tonnes of rice to support the sex workers during the hiatus.\n\nProstitution is illegal in mainly Muslim Bangladesh, but Ashiqur said they do not interfere in the trade, which has operated in the country for centuries.\n\nDaulatdia brothel on the bank of river Padma and near a major highway some 100 kilometres west of Dhaka is the largest of the approximately 12 brothels in the country.\n\nJhumur Begum, who heads a charity for sex workers, said the brothel, where some 1,500 sex workers are employed, is frequented by about 5,000 customers everyday.\n\nBegum said they have appealed to the authorities for help after the brothel was declared closed as a precaution for coronavirus.\n\n\u00abThe sex workers accepted the government order because it\u2019s a serious health issue,\u00bb she told EFE.\n\n\u00abBut at the same time we request the authorities help these sex workers. If the brothel remains closed for long it will be difficult for them to survive,\u00bb she said.\n\nBangladesh has so far 20 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including three detected in the last 24 hours, and one death.\n\nThe authorities did not disclose the identity of the infected people but restricted public movement in Shibchar area of central Madaripur district on Thursday, saying that most of the cases were referred from that area.\n\nShibchar is home to thousands of people who live in Italy, which is now bearing the brunt of the global pandemic. More than 3,500 people have died there.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s Directorate General of Health Services at a press conference on Friday said a total of 14,264 people in the country had been put in a home quarantine so far while 107 people were being kept in isolation for suspected coronavirus infections.\n\nBangladesh authorities have banned all flights from Europe, except the United Kingdom, until March 31 and also declared all educational institutes of the country and sporting activities closed until the end of this month.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 20 18:10:20 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "es", "meta_favicon": "https://laredodaily.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bTj5SLtd_400x400.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://laredodaily.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bangladesh.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 467}, "url": "https://laredodaily.news/bangladesh-shuts-largest-brothel-over-coronavirus-fears/", "title": "Bangladesh shuts largest brothel over coronavirus fears", "description": "Dhaka.- Authorities in Bangladesh on Friday ordered the closure of the country\u2019s largest brothel for 15 days as the nation braces itself for the coronavirus pandemic.
