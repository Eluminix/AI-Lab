In France, for example, the government urges citizens to stay \u2018at least one metre\u2019 away from others.\n\nExperts heading up the government\u2019s response to Covid stressed the importance of the current rules on Thursday, although they did highlight grey areas in the science of social distancing.\n\nThe Government\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: \u2018It\u2019s not an absolute (that) beyond two metres is safe and slightly less is not safe, there\u2019s a graduation across that, and so roughly at a metre it\u2019s somewhere between 10 and 30 times more risky than at two metres.\u2019\n\nEngland\u2019s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said that staying two metres apart when meeting someone outside would rule them out of being counted as a contact under the track & trace scheme \u2013 meaning one would not need to self-isolate if the other developed coronavirus.\n\nBoris Johnson added: \u2018I must stress that to control the virus, everyone needs to stay alert, act responsibly, strictly observe social distancing rules, and stay two metres apart from those who you do not live with.\u2019\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["UK", "Coronavirus"], "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "authors": ["Sam Courtney-Guy"], "publish_date": "Sat May 30 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Senior Tories have reportedly warned the PM that social distancing at two metres could kill off thousands of hospitality jobs.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/m-icon-black-32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/m-icon-black-270.png", "msvalidate.01": "AE7395BB35A71648216DC12EB230C308", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "ob": {"article": {"section": {"name": "UK", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/news/uk/"}}}, "sailthru.date": "2020-05-30 12:03:16", "sailthru.title": "Shorten two-metre rule to save jobs, MPs urge Boris", "sailthru.tags": "coronavirus", "sailthru.description": "Senior Tories have reportedly warned the PM that social distancing at two metres could kill off thousands of hospitality jobs.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRC_153048276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=77px%2C0px%2C518px%2C518px&resize=150%2C150", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRC_153048276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=77px%2C0px%2C518px%2C518px&resize=150%2C150&w=50", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "description": "Senior Tories have reportedly warned the PM that social distancing at two metres could kill off thousands of hospitality jobs.", "keywords": "UK,Coronavirus", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Shorten two-metre rule to save jobs, MPs urge Boris", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/30/shorten-two-metre-rule-save-jobs-mps-urge-boris-12779438/", "description": "Senior Tories have reportedly warned the PM that social distancing at two metres could kill off thousands of hospitality jobs.", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRC_153048276_1590836864.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRC_153048276_1590836864.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "News", "tag": "Coronavirus", "published_time": "2020-05-30T12:03:16+0000", "modified_time": "2020-05-30T12:07:44+0100"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/PRC_153048276.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Shorten two-metre rule to save jobs, MPs urge Boris", "description": "Senior Tories have reportedly warned the PM that social distancing at two metres could kill off thousands of hospitality jobs.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 176908729004638}, "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "pocket-site-verification": "8aec208948f7b2f9092ac4ce91dac7"}, "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/30/shorten-two-metre-rule-save-jobs-mps-urge-boris-12779438/"}
