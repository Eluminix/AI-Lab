A 99-year-old WWII veteran has beaten COVID-19! He was given a round of applause as he was discharged from the hospital. Albert Chambers is back home after recovering from the deadly virus at Tickhill Road Hospital in Doncaster, northern England. The courageous vet turns 100 in July!\n\nAlbert was admitted to the hospital three weeks ago after injuring his wrist in a fall. While he was there, he began to show coronavirus-like symptoms and soon tested positive for the virus. Despite everyone fearing the worst, he miraculously recovered. When he was being discharged, he was seen off with a guard of honor and the incredible moment was captured on video, too!\n\nAlbert Chambers miraculously beats COVID-19\n\n\u201cThank you very much, I appreciate every bit you\u2019ve done for me. It couldn\u2019t have been better,\u201d Albert tells the nurses who took care of him while he was sick. His grandson, 49-year-old Stephen Gater, said that they were preparing for the worst when they learned their grandfather had contracted coronavirus. However, they say that they believe Albert\u2019s \u201cfortitude\u201d was what helped him pull through\u2026 the fortitude that he earned during his time as a British Army soldier during World War II.\n\nRELATED: Coronavirus Survivor Turns 104, Survived WWII And 1918 Flu\n\nIn the midst of the war, Albert was captured by the enemy after being injured in a bomb blast in North Africa. He was then Fallingbostel in northwestern Germany and was held there as a prisoner of war for three years. After that war, he would continue to protect London\u2019s royal palaces in the Coldstream Guards.\n\nUsing his story as a message of hope\n\n\u201cMy grandad is amazing. He\u2019s pretty incredible. He\u2019s not only survived the war and being in prison camp, now he\u2019s won the battle with coronavirus,\u201d Albert\u2019s grandson says of his grandfather. Gater also says that the family hopes to use Albert\u2019s story as a hopeful message during these difficult times.\n\n\u201cWhen we heard the news we feared the worst but he\u2019s pulled through and it\u2019s amazing \u2014 the staff there are incredible and we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. We were clapping very ferociously last night at 8 o\u2019clock along with everyone else. It\u2019s testament to the care he was getting and his positive attitude and his fortitude.\u201d We\u2019re so happy to hear that Albert has recovered and is resting at home now!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jane Kenney"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 14 11:00:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Nurses gave 99-year-old WWII vet Albert Chambers a proper guard of honor as he was discharged from the hospital after beating coronavirus.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DoYouRemember_-Knowledge-Graph-Logo-112x108.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Nurses gave 99-year-old WWII vet Albert Chambers a proper guard of honor as he was discharged from the hospital after beating coronavirus.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nurses Applaud 99-Year-Old WWII Vet After He Beats Coronavirus", "description": "Nurses gave 99-year-old WWII vet Albert Chambers a proper guard of honor as he was discharged from the hospital after beating coronavirus.", "url": "https://doyouremember.com/116113/99-year-old-albert-chambers-beats-coronavirus", "site_name": "DoYouRemember?", "image": {"identifier": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Nurses-Applaud-99-Year-Old-WWII-Vet-After-He-Beats-Coronavirus.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DoYouRemember/", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jane.kenney.33", "published_time": "2020-04-14T11:00:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-01-29T11:38:14+00:00"}, "author": "Jane Kenney", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@DoYouRemember", "site": "@DoYouRemember", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jane Kenney", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "theme-color": "#8a2299", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "google-site-verification": "GcAFD5oqPDvTtdW_dIblelB8LL2Td6V4wPH51RU0RKo", "p": {"domain_verify": "b9a4f036b4bf82863a0e68cf57a5c34c"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DoYouRemember_-Knowledge-Graph-Logo.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://doyouremember.com/116113/99-year-old-albert-chambers-beats-coronavirus"}
