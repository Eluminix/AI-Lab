It is understood that customers with tickets issued to fly on the route will be offered a refund or change of departure date and that Iberia will contact other airlines to find alternative solutions for those who need to return to their place of origin.\n\nIberia will continue to analyse the spread of coronavirus and determine whether it is necessary to prolong the suspension which has been enforced \u2013 \u201cfor reasons that are of greater cause, and for the safety of our customers and employees.\u201d\n\nThe move comes after British Airways and Lufthansa suspended flights to and from China, while agencies and tour operators have also advocated suspending trips to the country. The IAG air group, who operate British Airways, had enforced the blockage after the British Foreign Ministry recommended civilians to not travel to China, where so far, coronavirus has claimed the lives of 132 people.\n\nFrom February, American Airlines and United Airlines have also suspended part of its service to China claiming a fall in demand. The Hong Kong flag airline, Cathay Pacific, has opted for a progressive reduction on its flights to China, also ceasing to provide some services on board such as hot towels, blankets and magazines.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 29 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SPAIN\u2019S Iberia has announced that it will suspend its flights with the city of Shanghai in China, due to increasing fears over the spread of the deadly\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/themes/euronews/dist/images/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "SPAIN\u2019S Iberia has announced that it will suspend its flights with the city of Shanghai in China, due to increasing fears over the spread of the deadly\u2026", "og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Euro Weekly News", "title": "Spain\u2019s Iberia suspends all flights to and from China after deadly coronavirus outbreak", "description": "SPAIN\u2019S Iberia has announced that it will suspend its flights with the city of Shanghai in China, due to increasing fears over the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
