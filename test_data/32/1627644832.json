accused China of using the unrest triggered by the death of George Floyd in police custody to justify denying its own people basic human rights.\n\n\u201cAs with dictatorships throughout history, no lie is too obscene, so long as it serves the Party\u2019s lust for power,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\u201cThis laughable propaganda should not fool anyone,\u201d Pompeo added.\n\nChina has repeatedly criticized the US over the Floyd case but it was not immediately clear which of its comments Pompeo was referring to.\n\nBeijing has long been infuriated by criticism from Western capitals, especially Washington, over its handling of the pro-democracy protests that shook Hong Kong last year.\n\nAnd as unrest erupted across the United States over racial inequality and police brutality after the May 25 death of Floyd, an unarmed black man, Chinese government spokespeople and official media launched broadsides against American authorities.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on June 1 seized on the anti-racism protests in the US to accuse the US of hypocrisy, calling racism \u201ca chronic disease of American society.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s response to the death of Floyd at the hands of police was a \u201ctextbook example of its world-famous double standards,\u201d Zhao said.\n\n\u201cWhy does the US lionize the so-called Hong Kong independence and black violence elements as heroes and activists, while calling people who protest against racism \u2018rioters\u2019?\u201d Zhao asked.\n\nIn his statement Saturday, Pompeo said Beijing in recent days had shown \u201ccontinuing contempt for the truth and scorn for law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe CCP\u2019s propaganda efforts \u2014 seeking to conflate the United States\u2019 actions in the wake of the death of George Floyd with the CCP\u2019s denial of basic human rights and freedom \u2014 should be seen for the fraud that they are,\u201d Pompeo wrote.\n\nHis remarks came at a low point in US-Chinese relations, with President Donald Trump harshly criticizing Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \u2014 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US", "accuses", "China", "of", "using", "Floyd", "death", "for", "propaganda"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date":
