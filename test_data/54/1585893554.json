Community\u2019s housing stock, much the same as in many European countries, means that for many people and families, lockdown and isolation is made more difficult to deal with due to the lack of any views at all.\n\nAccording to a study carried out by Idealista, this applies to 5.6 per cent of homes in the Valencian Community, and 7.9 per cent in Spain as a whole.\n\nAmong the Community\u2019s province, the most affected by this type of \u2018interior home\u2019 situation is Castellon, with 6.6 per cent of its housing stock having no views at all, followed by Valencia with 5.3 per cent, and Alicante with 3 per cent.\n\nBy Autonomous Community, Madrid is the region with the highest percentage of homes with no views (15.4 per cent), followed by the Canarias (9.8 per cent), Aragon (8.4), Islas Baleares (7.8), Catalonia (7.1), Castilla-La Mancha (6.6), La Rioja (6.4), Asturias (6.1), Euskadi (5.7), Andalucia and the Valencia Community (5.6 per cent in both).\n\nCantabria leads the regions with the lowest percentage of interior dwellings, with only 1.3 per cent, followed by Navarra (3.1), Murcia (3.3), Extremadura (3.4), Galicia and Castilla y Leon (4 per cent in each).\n\nIdealista came to these findings by analysing all the homes, both for sale and rent, that have been advertised in its database in the last 12 months.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""],
