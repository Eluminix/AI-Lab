The victim was hit multiple times in his torso, said Sgt. John Faessel of the Cypress Police Department.\n\nWithin minutes, dozens of attendees fled the area. When police arrived, they found no one at the burial site, Faessel said. But some officers were redirected to the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Moody Street. They found the injured man there.\n\nDespite being shot multiple times, the man did not have any life-threatening injuries, Faessel said.\n\nDetectives believe the shooting was the result of a personal conflict between the two men.\n\n\u201cFrom what we understand, the people involved all know each other,\u201d Faessel said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t some unknown person who showed up.\u201d\n\nWhile the suspect was known to the people at the funeral, police haven\u2019t identified him or released a description. It\u2019s not clear whether witnesses to the shooting have helped in the investigation.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t completely out of the ordinary,\u201d Faessel said of the shooting.\n\nHe noted detectives were looking into the possibility of an inter-family conflict that led to the violence.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a scenario were there\u2019s family issues at play, or you can image a scenario where people who may want to pay their respects to the deceased family member aren\u2019t necessarily there to pay their respect to other family members,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice were still looking for the suspect. They asked anyone with information about the shooting to call the Cypress Police Department Criminal Investigation Bureau at (714) 229-6631, or Orange County Crime Stoppers at 1-855-TIP-OCCS.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Horse Racing", "Corrections", "About OC Register", "UCLA Sports", "Best of Orange County", "Investigative Reporting", "SCNG Premium", "USC Sports"], "authors": ["Josh Cain"], "publish_date": "Sun May 24 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "At around 3:30 p.m., police said around two dozen people were just heading back to their cars from the service at the cemetery at 4471 Lincoln Avenue ending when two men got into an argument.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-ocr_icon11.jpg?w=32", "meta_data": {"application-name": "orangecountyregister", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "mrf": {"authors": "Josh Cain", "canonical": "https://www.ocregister.com/2020/05/24/cypress-police-still-searching-for-gunman-who-shot-another-man-after-forest-lawn-burial/"}, "description": "At around 3:30 p.m., police said around two dozen people were just heading back to their cars from the service at the cemetery at 4471 Lincoln Avenue ending when two men got into an argument.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "fb": {"pages": 6883399629}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cypress police still searching for gunman who shot another man after Forest Lawn burial", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2020/05/24/cypress-police-still-searching-for-gunman-who-shot-another-man-after-forest-lawn-burial/", "description": "At around 3:30 p.m., police said around two dozen people were just heading back to their cars from the service at the cemetery at 4471 Lincoln Avenue ending when two men got into an argument.", "site_name": "Orange County Register", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OCR-Z-CYPRESS-SHOOT-0524-3.jpg?w=797&h=448", "width": 797, "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-05-24T19:34:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-24T19:35:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Cypress police still searching for gunman who shot another man after Forest Lawn burial"}, "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OCR-Z-CYPRESS-SHOOT-0524-3.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-ocr_icon11.jpg?w=270"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.ocregister.com/2020/05/24/cypress-police-still-searching-for-gunman-who-shot-another-man-after-forest-lawn-burial/"}
