Anne wrote with searing honesty about her feelings towards its other occupants, in particular her difficult relationship with her mother.\n\nShe also harboured serious ambitions of being a writer, penning stories and starting her own book about her experiences.\n\nThrough it all, there remains the voice of a schoolgirl examining her place in the world -- just like today's young people, says Leopold.\n\n\"She's their peer. They recognise her voice, what she was thinking of, what she was doing when she was struggling with her relationship with her mother,\" he said.\n\nThe last entry was on August 1, 1944. Three days later, German agents raided the house.\n\nThere are several theories about why, including that the Franks were betrayed by neighbours or because of black market activities in the warehouse below, but as Leopold says \"it's all unsubstantiated, so we don't know.\"\n\nThe Franks were transported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp -- but were split up and Anne and Margot were sent to Belsen.\n\nBoth sisters contracted typhus and Anne is believed to have died some time in February 1945, two months before Allied troops liberated Belsen on April 15.\n\n'Challenging times'\n\nAfter the war, Otto Frank returned to Amsterdam to find his wife and daughters dead and the house stripped.\n\nIn all, only 38,000 of the 140,000 Jews who lived in the Netherlands survived the Holocaust -- one of the highest percentages of any European nation, and a lasting shame for the country which only this year issued the first government apology.\n\nBut the diary had been saved by Miep Gies, one of the people who had helped those in the secret annexe.\n\nAfter several rejections, it was published in 1947 in Dutch, said Leopold, although it did not become the phenomenon it is now until it was finally published in English in the United States in 1952.\n\nOver the years further research into the papers has revealed different sides to Anne.\n\nPassages about her sexuality as well as Edith Frank that Otto Frank had edited out of the original version were restored in later editions.\n\nThe diary's immediacy means it has kept its relevance, especially in the \"challenging times that we live in in 2020\" with the \"rise of nationalism, the rise of the extreme right wing,\" said Leopold.\n\n\"What was done to Anne Frank was the work of human beings, and I think it's important to learn about that.\"\n\nThe Anne Frank House -- which is currently closed to the public because of the coronavirus but continues its educational programmes -- is now focused on communicating her legacy for the next 75 years, as memories of the Holocaust fade.\n\nThat can be a challenge, Leopold admitted, with younger social media obsessed visitors seemingly as interested in taking selfies as in history.\n\nBut, he said, that interest in her story was \"increasing rather than decreasing\", with half of the Anne Frank House's 1.3 million visitors a year being aged under 30.\n\n\"It's a mirror to us,\" said Leopold.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Europe"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "publish_date": "Sun Apr 12 11:06:29 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Seventy-five years ago this year, after their hiding place was discovered, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, aged 15", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/Content/responsive/VOA/img/webApp/favicon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Seventy-five years ago this year, after their hiding place was discovered, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, aged 15", "keywords": "Europe", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 36235438073, "app_id": 362002700549372}, "msvalidate.01": "3286EE554B6F672A6F2E608C02343C0E", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "VOA", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=632618796, app-argument=//6187400.ltr", "og": {"title": "Anne Frank's Diary More Relevant Than Ever, 75 Years on", "description": "Seventy-five years ago this year, after their hiding place was discovered, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, aged 15", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.voanews.com/a/europe_anne-franks-diary-more-relevant-ever-75-years/6187400.html", "site_name": "Voice of America", "image": {"identifier": "https://gdb.voanews.com/c965a26d-23de-43f5-8563-673d6af88c35_w1200_h630.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "Author": "Agence France-Presse", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voanews", "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/c965a26d-23de-43f5-8563-673d6af88c35_w1200_h630.jpg", "title": "Anne Frank's Diary More Relevant Than Ever, 75 Years on", "description": "Seventy-five years ago this year, after their hiding place was discovered, Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany, aged 15"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Content/responsive/VOA/img/webApp/ico-144x144.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.voanews.com/a/europe_anne-franks-diary-more-relevant-ever-75-years/6187400.html"}
