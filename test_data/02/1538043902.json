There can be no exhaustive exposition of circumstances in which an applicant may be held entitled to approach the high court directly. The court would err in attempting to draw a uniform code ordictum that may guide the exercise of discretion vested in the court. The discretion left unfettered by the legislature must be recognised. The contingencies spelled out in Vinod Kumar case as illustrative of special circumstances may, where duly established, constitute the ground to petition high court directly.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Prayagraj news", "Prayagraj latest news", "Prayagraj news live", "Prayagraj news today", "Today news Prayagraj", "Yashwant Verma", "Ramesh Sinha", "Rahul Chaturvedi", "Govind Mathur", "Allahabad HC"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "keywords": "Prayagraj news, Prayagraj latest news, Prayagraj news live, Prayagraj news today, Today news Prayagraj,Yashwant Verma,Ramesh Sinha,Rahul Chaturvedi,Govind Mathur,Allahabad HC", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "'Petitioners can directly move high court for anticipatory bail' | Prayagraj News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74469878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228395,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74469878,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228395,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "'Petitioners can directly move high court for anticipatory bail' | Prayagraj News - Times of India", "description": "A five-judge bench of Allahabad HC on Monday ruled it's not mandatory to approach the sessions court first, before moving the HC for anticipatory bail", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Yashwant Verma,Ramesh Sinha,Rahul Chaturvedi,Govind Mathur,Allahabad HC", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/allahabad/petitioners-can-directly-move-high-court-for-anticipatory-bail/articleshow/74469857.cms"}
