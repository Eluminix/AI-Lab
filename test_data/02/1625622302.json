Peugeot's e-208 GT, costing 36,600 euros, will also benefit.In Germany, electric cars made up 1.8% of new passenger car registrations last year, with diesel and petrol cars accounting for 32% and 59.2% percent respectively. Hybrid cars made up 6.6% of new registrations in 2019.Germany said its motor vehicle tax will be reformed. From January 2021, cars with an emission of more than 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre will face a staggered tax.The average vehicle emissions of a new car last year in Germany was around 150.9 grams of CO2 per kilometre.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["VW", "volkswagen", "sweeping incentives", "stimulus package", "Kia Motors", "Germany", "Electric Push", "coronavirus", "bmw", "Battery Electric Vehicle"], "tags": ["Volkswagen", "coronavirus"], "authors": ["Reuters"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "News News: BERLIN: Germany unveiled sweeping incentives for cheap electric cars and for hybrid vehicles, providing a boost to Volkswagen's electric push while st.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://m.timesofindia.com/touch-icon-iphone-precomposed.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "News News: BERLIN: Germany unveiled sweeping incentives for cheap electric cars and for hybrid vehicles, providing a boost to Volkswagen's electric push while st.", "keywords": "VW,volkswagen,sweeping incentives,stimulus package,Kia Motors,Germany,Electric Push,coronavirus,bmw,Battery Electric Vehicle", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "German auto stimulus to boost Volkswagen's electric push - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/german-auto-stimulus-to-boost-volkswagens-electric-push/articleshow/76191772.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76191798,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-828366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "News News: BERLIN: Germany unveiled sweeping incentives for cheap electric cars and for hybrid vehicles, providing a boost to Volkswagen's electric push while st.", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/german-auto-stimulus-to-boost-volkswagens-electric-push/articleshow/76191772.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76191798,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-828366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "German auto stimulus to boost Volkswagen's electric push - Times of India", "description": "News News: BERLIN: Germany unveiled sweeping incentives for cheap electric cars and for hybrid vehicles, providing a boost to Volkswagen's electric push while st.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "Auto news, Cars, Bikes, Automobile news, Auto news IndiaVW,volkswagen,sweeping incentives,stimulus package,Kia Motors,Germany,Electric Push,coronavirus,bmw,Battery Electric Vehicle", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/german-auto-stimulus-to-boost-volkswagens-electric-push/articleshow/76191772.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/auto/news/german-auto-stimulus-to-boost-volkswagens-electric-push/articleshow/76191772.cms"}
