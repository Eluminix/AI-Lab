Our European culture\u201d, the Democratic presidential candidate appears to have said, detailing an unequivocal view on the issue of American identity in the short clip.\n\nBiden proclaims the 'European' identity of America: \"Our culture is not imported from some African nation.\" pic.twitter.com/mG1ys8fzWB \u2014 \u13d4\u10db\u01a6\ud835\udd22\u10f3\ud83d\udca4 (@mooncult) 2 January 2020\n\n\u200bThe controversial footage - which currently has over a million views - has been debunked by the Biden campaign as misleadingly doctored, as excerpts from his original speech were taken out of context as a means of specifically tarnishing Biden and his political image.\n\nIt was revealed that the edited 20 seconds of Biden's remarks were taken from ABC News coverage of Biden speaking for over an hour in Derry, New Hampshire, on 30 December 2019. The full video shows that Biden was commenting on changing the US culture around violence against women.\n\n\u201cFolks, this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture, it\u2019s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation. It is our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture that says it is all right\u201d, Biden stressed, while debating the difficulty victims face in reporting sexual assault on college campuses.\n\nNevertheless, some netizens claimed that Biden really does sound like a bigot.\n\nAndy, why do you support Joe Biden, the man who wrote the crime bill, who worked with segregationists, & who wanted to cuts Social Security 3 times? It's like you admit that you are a racist & a bigot towards seniors & PoC. Can't quite put my finger on it \ud83e\udd14 maybe you can clarify \u2014 Jaime Flores, Year 2020 #NotMeUs #BernieOrBust (@wow712) December 29, 2019\n\nBiden proclaims the 'European' identity of America: \"Our culture is not imported from some African nation.\" This is not only incorrect it's racist\n\nCulture; the customs, arts, social institutions, and achievements of a particular nation, people, or other social group. #JoeBiden \u2014 Dred Pirate Rap (@Protest_Works) January 2, 2020\n\nBiden is a DINO, he's basically a Republican, and I'd take almost anyone else as the Democratic nominee.\n\nWarren has issues, I recognize that - she's not left-wing enough for my tastes, but at least she's not a racist grandpa. \u2014 Lizzard Crow (@lizzardcrow) January 1, 2020\n\nBiden has a mile long history of misogyny racism and homophobia. Warren was a republican until almost 50, and pretended to be Native American until 70. She supported Reagan. Buttigieg has a demonstrably racist career history.
