Ms. Sitharaman on Saturday said the Narendra Modi government plans to sell a part of its stake in the entity through an initial public offering (IPO) and raise funds.\n\nSitharaman, however, did not give details such as what percentage of holding would be sold or when it would take place. Listing of companies on stock exchanges \u201cdiscipline a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives (an) opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created,\u201d she said.\n\nThe government owns 100% stake in LIC, which was set up in 1956 and remains the country\u2019s largest state-run insurer. LIC increased its share of the first-year premium income in the first nine months of this fiscal, rising to 70.52% from 66.24% recorded in 2018-19. According to Bloomberg estimates, its assets roughly equal $433 billion (over \u20b930 lakh crore).\n\nThe Economic Survey 2020 has aggressively pitched for divestment in public sector undertakings (PSUs). The latest development comes close on the heels of the Union government\u2019s announcement Monday to invite bids for 100% stake sale of national carrier Air India.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["LIC", "life insurance corporation", "LIC India", "Budget 2020 India", "Union Budget 2020", "India Budget 2020 News", "Budget Expectations", "Latest Union Budget 2020 Updates", "Nirmala Sitharaman", "India Budget Date", "Budget News", "Budget 2020 Expectations", "Budget Announcements", "Budget Impact", "Union Budget Highlights", "Union Budget 2020 by Nirmala Sitaraman", "union budget 2020 date", "union budget 2020 expectations", "budget 2020 income tax"], "tags": ["Hindi Belt", "Monkeypox", "Spotlight", "Good Health Hunting", "Live Now", "ISRO", "Decode Karnataka", "Question Corner", "Data Point Podcast", "Live news", "Ground Zero", "Between Wickets", "Focus Tamil Nadu"], "authors": ["Authors"], "publish_date": "Sat Feb  1 09:24:11 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Budget 2020 | LIC to go public, says Nirmala Sitharaman", "description": "Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister", "publish-date": "2020-02-01T14:54:11+05:30", "created-date": "2020-02-01T14:54:11+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-02-01T16:37:21+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-01T09:24:11.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-02-01T11:07:21Z", "section": "Budget", "tag": "budget 2020 income tax", "author": "Saira Aslam"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 61637493, "thg-articleid": 61637493, "thg-articletype": "story", "title": "Budget 2020 | LIC to go public, says Nirmala Sitharaman", "description": "Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-lic-to-go-public-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30711555.ece", "app_name": "The Hindu", "package": "com.mobstac.thehindu"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "Saira Aslam", "title": "Budget 2020 | LIC to go public, says Nirmala Sitharaman", "description": "Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister", "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/business/46dsj/article53359098.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/LIC", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "ipad": "The Hindu", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindu.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "site": "@The_Hindu"}, "keywords": "LIC,life insurance corporation,LIC India,Budget 2020 India,Union Budget 2020,India Budget 2020 News,Budget Expectations,Latest Union Budget 2020 Updates,Nirmala Sitharaman,India Budget Date,Budget News,Budget 2020 Expectations,Budget Announcements,Budget Impact,Union Budget Highlights,Union Budget 2020 by Nirmala Sitaraman,union budget 2020 date,union budget 2020 expectations,budget 2020 income tax", "news_keywords": "LIC,life insurance corporation,LIC India,Budget 2020 India,Union Budget 2020,India Budget 2020 News,Budget Expectations,Latest Union Budget 2020 Updates,Nirmala Sitharaman,India Budget Date,Budget News,Budget 2020 Expectations,Budget Announcements,Budget Impact,Union Budget Highlights,Union Budget 2020 by Nirmala Sitaraman,union budget 2020 date,union budget 2020 expectations,budget 2020 income tax", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "Budget 2020 | LIC to go public, says Nirmala Sitharaman", "description": "Move will bring in better financial discipline among entities, according to Finance Minister", "image": {"identifier": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/business/46dsj/article53359098.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/LIC", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-lic-to-go-public-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30711555.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Hindu"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321, app-argument=https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-lic-to-go-public-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30711555.ece", "google-signin-client_id": "853251516072-1eudfpp9hhjtjp31fpm8g9fus3ig0ec3.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "jlS-WsOVad-iw4X4xO0EJnHuzr3pK7WqXt3oCy7jpXI", "msvalidate": {"01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2"}, "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-lic-to-go-public-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30711555.ece"}
