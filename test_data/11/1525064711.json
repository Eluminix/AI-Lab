"VANCOUVER \u2014 A small, mobile RCMP detachment in a remote area of British Columbia has become a bargaining chip in proposed talks that many hope could put an end to blockades that have disrupted rail and road traffic across the country.\n\nThe demonstrations are in support of Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline through their territory and the federal minister in charge of Indigenous relations has proposed a meeting with the chiefs to diffuse the situation.\n\nHowever, a hereditary chief representing one of 13 Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en house groups, said they won\u2019t meet with Carolyn Bennett and her B.C. counterpart Scott Fraser until the RCMP detachment is removed.\n\nChief Woos accuses the RCMP of acting as \u201cbullies,\u201d and says all hereditary chiefs are in agreement.\n\nRCMP say in a statement they are aware of the request and discussions are underway on next steps, while Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said during an emergency debate that \u201cthere is a clear path forward.\u201d\n\nSaskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has called his own meeting, saying on Twitter that as chairman of the Council of the Federation he will convene a conference call with Canada\u2019s premiers.\n\nMoe said the blockades have been up for almost two weeks and while the prime minister spoke in Parliament about the ongoing illegal activity \u201che offered no course of action to protect the economic interests of our nation.\u201d\n\nWoos, who also goes by Frank Alec, said they\u2019ll start talking about meeting with politicians when the chiefs\u2019 message gets through to the RCMP.\n\nThe detachment is located off a forest service road where 28 people were arrested this month when RCMP enforced an injunction on behalf of Coastal GasLink, which is building a natural gas pipeline through the area.\n\n\u201cPick up everything and go and do not return,\u201d Woos said.\n\nWhile the RCMP have said their major operations in the region have concluded, they have also said the mobile unit will remain in place and they\u2019ll continue \u201cpatrols of the corridor to ensure everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nAlthough 20 elected First Nations councils along the 670-kilometre path of the Coastal GasLink pipeline have signed agreements with the company, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs say the project has no authority without their consent.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called for patience, as he faced demands from the Opposition Conservatives to crack down on protesters.\n\nRecognizing the crisis as \u201ca critical moment for our country and for our future,\u201d the prime minister acknowledged that people on all sides are frustrated.\n\n\u201cWhat we are facing was not created overnight,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt was not created because we have embarked upon a path of reconciliation recently in our history. It is because for too long in our history, for too many years, we failed to do so. Therefore, finding a solution will not be simple.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate, Miller said Bennett spoke with hereditary chiefs Tuesday.\n\nThe situation is evolving hour by hour, he said, describing the de-escalation efforts as positive.\n\n\u201cClearly we see there is a path forward, we see there is modest and positive progress,\u201d he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 19, 2020.\n\nAmy Smart, The Canadian Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["News Staff", "Amy Smart", "The Canadian Press", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 19 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hereditary chiefs say they'll meet with ministers if RCMP get out", "description": "VANCOUVER \u2014 A small, mobile RCMP detachment in\u00a0a remote area of\u00a0British Columbia has become a bargaining chip in proposed talks that many hope could put an end to blockades that have disrupted rail and road traffic across the country.
