Here's what you need to do beforehand.\n\nTo receive a coronavirus economic stimulus payment, Americans need to have filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019, according to new guidance released by the IRS and U.S. Treasury. (iStock / Getty Images Plus)\n\nRHODE ISLAND \u2014 In the next three weeks, most Americans are expected to start receiving payments that are part of a nearly $2 trillion economic stimulus package approved by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last week. The package is intended to mitigate the economic effects of the new coronavirus outbreak on Americans, small businesses and corporations.\n\nBut with so much money in the pipeline, questions remain: What is the government using to determine eligibility? Do we need to apply to receive a payment? Where will the payment go once it's sent? The Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury released guidance this week on the economic stimulus package that explains what Americans should expect and what they need to do to receive their payments. Most won't need to do anything. But just in case, here's a checklist of questions you may not have thought of and others you may already be asking:\n\nDo I need to file a tax return to receive a stimulus payment?\n\nYes, and while most of us won't need to worry about this requirement, some groups of Americans \u2014 including low-income taxpayers, senior citizens, some veterans and individuals with disabilities \u2014 typically don't file tax returns. Don't miss the latest coronavirus updates in Rhode Island as they are announced.

Finally, anyone who was required to file taxes for 2018 and 2019 and hasn't done so yet should do so right away.\n\nAm I eligible for the economic stimulus payment? Eligible taxpayers who filed tax returns for either 2019 or 2018 will automatically receive an economic impact payment of up to $1,200 for individuals or $2,400 for married couples. Parents also receive $500 for each qualifying child.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Apr  2 19:58:02 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Coronavirus Economic Stimulus Payments: What You Need To Do In RI - Cranston, RI - Rhode Island residents are expected to start receiving stimulus payments soon.
