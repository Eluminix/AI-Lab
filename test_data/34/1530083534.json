She remembered Gianna as intelligent, silly, and athletically skilled, calling the 13-year-old a \u201csweet and gentle soul.\u201d\n\n\u201cGigi was very competitive like her daddy, but Gianna had a sweet grace about her. Her smile was like sunshine. Her smile took up her entire face like mine \u2014 Kobe always said she was me. She had my fire. My personality and sarcasm. She was tender and loving on the inside. She had the best laugh. It was infectious. It was pure and genuine,\u201d Vanessa said of their daughter.\n\nShe remembered Kobe as a doting father who put his family first. She described him as a romantic and said she dreamed of growing old with him.\n\n\u201cGod knew they couldn\u2019t be on this earth without each other. He had to bring them home to heaven together,\u201d Vanessa said, adding \u201cBabe, you take care of our Gigi.\u201d May Kobe and Gianna rest in peace.
