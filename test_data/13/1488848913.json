This includes a new minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, rising to 18% for banks and energy utilities, where tax on capital gains above \u20ac140,000 will also be increased from 23 to 27%.\n\nThose with high paid jobs will also be impacted, where there is set to be an increase in income tax for those earning more than \u20ac300,000 a year by 4 percentage points. Although Sanchez states this is in aim of forming a \u201cgovernment for all people that broadens rights, restores co-existence and fights for social justice\u201d, many have voiced their outrage on the matter. Those who have achieved success in their professional career, contributing to society and creating jobs for others, see the increases as a brazen attempt of economic targeting.\n\nHowever, proposals to overhaul some of the labour changes introduced eight years ago when the conservative People\u2019s party was in power has delighted a proportion of the workforce. This includes measures such as strengthening protection against dismissal for absences caused by illness and lifting the minimum wage to 60% of average national wages.\n\nAlthough positive news for some, this will again impact business owners, who will now be subject to increased scrutiny and higher pay-outs to meet the governmental standards based upon worker-friendly legislation.\n\nIn a tweet sent after the vote, S\u00e1nchez wrote: \u201cWith the progressive coalition government, Spain is entering a time for the defence of dialogue and useful politics\u201d, where Unidas Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said the new coalition programme was designed to make Spain \u201ca world reference of modernity to support the most vulnerable groups.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Jan  7 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "SPAIN will now be led by a coalition government after acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez secured parliamentary approval for a joint administration between his\u2026", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/themes/euronews/dist/images/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "SPAIN will now be led by a coalition government after acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez secured parliamentary approval for a joint administration between his\u2026", "og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Euro Weekly News", "title": "Questionable Coalition: Tax hikes and labour rights - How Spain\u2019s new government will impact those residing in the country", "description": "SPAIN will now be led by a coalition government after acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez secured parliamentary approval for a joint administration between his Socialist party (PSOE) and the Unidas\u2026", "url": "https://euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/07/questionable-coalition-tax-hikes-and-labour-rights-how-spains-new-government-will-impact-those-residing-in-the-country/", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-EuroWeeklyNews-Favicon-2.png", "width": 512, "height": 512}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-07T18:08:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-07T18:08:33+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EuroWeeklyNews"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@euroweeklynews", "title": "Questionable Coalition: Tax hikes and labour rights - How Spain\u2019s new government will impact those residing in the country", "description": "SPAIN will now be led by a coalition government after acting Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez secured parliamentary approval for a joint administration between his Socialist party (PSOE) and the Unidas\u2026", "image": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/cropped-EuroWeeklyNews-Favicon-2.png"}, "generator": "MasterSlider 3.10.8 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | avt.li/msf", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.euroweeklynews.com/wp-content/themes/euronews/dist/images/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "canonical_link": "https://euroweeklynews.com/2020/01/07/questionable-coalition-tax-hikes-and-labour-rights-how-spains-new-government-will-impact-those-residing-in-the-country/"}
