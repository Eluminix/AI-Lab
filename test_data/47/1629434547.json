biggest daily increase ever as the pandemic worsens globally and has yet to peak in Central America, the WHO said on Monday, urging countries to press on with efforts to contains the virus.\n\n\u201cMore than six months into the pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal,\u201d WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online briefing.\n\nMore than 136 000 new cases were reported worldwide on Sunday, the most in a single day so far, he said.\n\nWHO media briefing on COVID-19:\n\nNearly 75% of them were reported from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia.\n\nIn response to a question on China, WHO\u2019s top emergencies expert, Dr. Mike Ryan, said retrospective studies of how the outbreak has been addressed could wait, adding: \u201cWe need to focus now on what we are doing today to prevent second peaks.\u201d\n\nRyan also said infections in Central American countries including Guatemala were still on the rise, and that they were \u201ccomplex\u201d epidemics.\n\n\u201cI think this is a time of great concern,\u201d he said, calling for strong government leadership and international support for the region.\n\nBrazil is now one of the hotspots of the pandemic, with the second highest number of confirmed cases, behind only the United States, and a death toll that last week surpassed Italy\u2019s.\n\nAfter removing cumulative numbers for coronavirus deaths in Brazil from a national website, the Health Ministry sowed further confusion and controversy by releasing two contradictory sets of figures for the latest tally of infection cases and fatalities.\n\nRyan said Brazil\u2019s data had been \u201cextremely detailed\u201d so far but stressed it was important for Brazilians to understand where the virus is and how to manage risk, and that the WHO hoped communication would be \u201cconsistent and transparent\u201d.\n\nMaria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that a \u201ccomprehensive approach\u201d was essential in South America.\n\nMore than 7 million people have been reported infected with the coronavirus globally and over 400 000 have died.\n\n\u201cThis is far from over,\u201d van Kerkhove said.\n\nAt least half of Singapore\u2019s newly discovered coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government\u2019s virus taskforce told Reuters on Monday, reinforcing the city-state\u2019s decision to ease lockdown restrictions very gradually.\n\nVan Kerkhove said that many countries doing contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases but were not finding that they caused further spread of the virus, adding: \u201cIt is very rare\u201d.\n\nRyan, asked about technical cooperation with the United States after President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement 10 days ago that it was terminating its relationship with the WHO, said the WHO relies heavily on experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to do that until we are otherwise instructed or informed,\u201d he added.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors":
