In addition to Reeves and Moss, actors already confirmed to be joining the cast include Jada Pinkett Smith (Niobe), as well as newcomers Jessica Henwick, Neil Patrick Harris, Toby Onwumere, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who is rumored to be playing young Morpheus.\n\nLambert Wilson might soon be added to the list, according to a recent report by French outlet Allocine (via The Playlist), that says Wilson, who played The Merovingian in \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions,\u201d is currently in negotiations to return to for the upcoming fourth film. Pproduction on the film may conflict with his schedule, so it\u2019s possible that he won\u2019t be back.\n\nIn the \u201cMatrix\u201d universe, The Merovingian (sometimes called The Frenchman) is an old, powerful program that resides within the Matrix. The self-described \u201ctrafficker of information\u201d and his wife Persephone (played by Monica Bellucci) operate a smuggling ring, providing a haven for exiled programs in the Matrix.\n\nAleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell, one of the most visionary sci-fi writers of our time, are co-writing the script with Wachowski. Mitchell is the author of \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d which the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer adapted into a 2012 film.\n\nAdditionally, cinematographer John Toll, Academy Award winner for \u201cBraveheart\u201d and \u201cLegends of the Fall,\u201d also nominated for Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Thin Red Line,\u201d will lens the fourth film.\n\nThe word is still out on if, Lilly Wachowski, the original trilogy\u2019s co-director, will be involved in the project.\n\nOver the course of the three previous \u201cMatrix\u201d films, which include \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded,\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions,\u201d the franchise grossed more than $1.6 billion at the global box office. However, the sequels were met with critical derision, which means \u201cMatrix 4\u201d may be an opportunity to stabilize the franchise\u2019s legacy.\n\nWilson will next be seen playing Charles de Gaulle, former President of France, in the French production, \u201cDe Gaulle.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tambay Obenson"], "publish_date": "Sat Jan 18 20:58:12 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Lambert Wilson, who played the character in last two films in the franchise, says it might happen, depending on his schedule.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=32", "meta_data": {"description": "Lambert Wilson, who played the character in last two films in the franchise, says it might happen, depending on his schedule.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "author": "Tambay Obenson", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Matrix 4\u2019: The Merovingian May Return to the Franchise", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/the-matrix-4-the-merovingian-may-return-1202204339/", "description": "Lambert Wilson, who played the character in last two films in the franchise, says it might happen, depending on his schedule.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-Matrix-Revolutions.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 423, "alt": "Editorial use only.
