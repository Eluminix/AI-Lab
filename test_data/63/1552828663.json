It would therefore be risky to release him on bail because there is a likelihood of absconding,\u201d said Ms Ngwenya.\n\nAccording to court papers, Ngwenya and Banda went on a fishing expedition at Sengwa Fishing Camp in Binga district where they had an altercation after arguing on the fish sale profits.\n\nDuring their fight, Ngwenya picked a log and struck Banda twice on the head.\n\nHe sustained head injuries and he was taken to Siabuwa Clinic the following day where he succumbed to the injuries.\n\nA report was made at the police leading to Ngwenya\u2019s arrest.\n\nAccording to the post mortem report the cause of death was skull fracture and assault.\n\nSubscribe to our Youtube Channel:", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mc Noel Kasinja"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 19 13:06:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-logo-32x32.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Dispute: Man Kills Business Partner Over Fish Sale Profits", "description": "A Zimbabwean man allegedly killed his Zambian business partner by striking him with a log following a heated dispute over the sharing of profits after the two h", "url": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/2020/03/19/dispute-man-kills-business-partner-over-fish-sale-profits/", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fish.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article", "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-19 13:06:28", "modified_time": "2020-03-19 13:06:28", "tag": "Paul Banda"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Dispute: Man Kills Business Partner Over Fish Sale Profits", "description": "A Zimbabwean man allegedly killed his Zambian business partner by striking him with a log following a heated dispute over the sharing of profits after the two h", "image": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fish.jpg"}, "author": "Mc Noel Kasinja", "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.152.1", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-logo-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.faceofmalawi.com/2020/03/19/dispute-man-kills-business-partner-over-fish-sale-profits/"}
