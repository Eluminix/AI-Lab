Plane maker Boeing Co itself on Wednesday said it was taking precautions including restricting travel to essential trips.\n\nChicago-based United\u2019s announcement followed a meeting of US President Donald Trump and the heads of the largest US airlines at the White House where they discussed the effect of the virus on the industry and demand.\n\nConcerns over the effect of reduced travel demand on airlines have hit airline shares and stoked fears of a financial bailout for the sector, an idea that the head of the US Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday moved quickly to dismiss.\n\nTrump also said on Wednesday that the airline executives had not asked for a bailout. After emerging from bankruptcy in the last 10 years and with new business models that include fees for everything from baggage to boarding, the main US airline companies are in a better financial position to weather a crisis, analysts have said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnchartered territory\n\nThe rapid, global spread of the virus has forced airlines to abandon their usual strategies for crisis management, which in the past have included lowering fares and redirecting flights to trouble-free areas.\n\nUntil now, United and other US carriers had only reduced flying to the areas most hit by coronavirus cases, though international rivals Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and British Airways recently announced broader reductions.\n\nLeaders of the unions representing United\u2019s pilots and flight attendants called the move a \u201cresponsible approach\u201d to addressing the effect of COVID-19 on air travel.\n\nIn one effort to win over hesitant travellers, US airlines have suspended rebooking fees for new ticket reservations.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Economy", "Aviation", "Business and Economy", "Coronavirus pandemic", "Muslim Ban", "United States", "US & Canada"], "tags": ["Human Rights", "Coronavirus pandemic", "India-Pakistan tensions", "Explained", "Donald Trump", "War on Gaza", "Science & Technology", "Russia-Ukraine war"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The US airlines say they are responding to the drop in demand as the coronavirus outbreak hits the travel industry.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon_aje.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "The US airlines say they are responding to the drop in demand as the coronavirus outbreak hits the travel industry.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "user": {"signinStatus": "Signed Out", "verificationStatus": "Not Verified"}, "topics": "Economy", "primaryTopic": "Economy", "where": "United States, US & Canada", "tags": "Aviation, Business and Economy, Coronavirus pandemic, Muslim Ban", "primaryTag": "Coronavirus pandemic", "keywords": "Economy, Aviation, Business and Economy, Coronavirus pandemic, Muslim Ban, United States, US & Canada", "taxonomyTerms": "Economy, Aviation, Business and Economy, Coronavirus pandemic, Muslim Ban, United States, US & Canada", "publishedDate": "2020-03-05T04:00:56", "lastDate": "2020-03-05T05:35:04", "contentType": "post", "sourceTaxonomy": "Reuters", "pageTitle": "United Airlines, JetBlue slash flights and spending due to virus", "postID": 1114977, "postLink": "/economy/2020/3/5/united-airlines-jetblue-slash-flights-and-spending-due-to-virus", "articleSlug": "united-airlines-jetblue-slash-flights-and-spending-due-to-virus", "source": "Reuters", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/3/5/united-airlines-jetblue-slash-flights-and-spending-due-to-virus", "title": "United Airlines, JetBlue slash flights and spending due to virus", "site_name": "Al Jazeera", "description": "The US airlines say they are responding to the drop in demand as the coronavirus outbreak hits the travel industry.", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/8e8e44fec38941a1847962293366da1c_18.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 5536782, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/3/5/united-airlines-jetblue-slash-flights-and-spending-due-to-virus", "title": "United Airlines, JetBlue slash flights and spending due to virus", "description": "The US airlines say they are responding to the drop in demand as the coronavirus outbreak hits the travel industry.", "image": {"src": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/8e8e44fec38941a1847962293366da1c_18.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675", "alt": "United Airlines, JetBlue slash flights and spending due to virus"}}, "pageSection": "Economy,Aviation,Business and Economy,Coronavirus pandemic,Muslim Ban", "pageType": "Article Page", "taxonomy-tags": "Economy, Aviation, Business and Economy, Coronavirus pandemic, Muslim Ban", "channel": "aje", "ga4": "G-XN9JB9Q0M1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1534955972"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/3/5/united-airlines-jetblue-slash-flights-and-spending-due-to-virus"}
