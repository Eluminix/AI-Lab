"movies": [], "text": "Editor's note: For the latest updates on the 2023 coronavirus outbreak, see our news coverage .\n\nWhat Is COVID-19?\n\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world. It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).\n\nIt spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren't a serious threat to otherwise healthy people.\n\nIs there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?\n\nYes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Mar 20 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus that causes mild to severe cases.
