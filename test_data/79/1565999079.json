The ban will in place through the next 30 days but will allow Americans in Europe to return home. The ban goes into effect on March 13, 2020 midnight.\n\nHere is the statement from the DHS:\n\nToday President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. These countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation.\n\nLike you can see, this statement does not include the United Kingdom at the moment as Trump suspends Europe travellers into the USA.\n\nTrump said there will be certain exemptions made for certain Americans \u201cwho have undergone appropriate screenings.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Defense separately announced on Wednesday it was placing a 60-day travel restriction for service members, Pentagon civilians and families travelling to, from or through China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, among others.\n\nAlso see: India suspends all visas through April 15, 2020.\n\nLiked our articles and our efforts?
