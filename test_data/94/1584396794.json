The estimate was announced alongside the release of the Global Report on Food Crises, produced by WFP and 15 other humanitarian and development partners.\n\nIn this context, it is vital that food assistance programme be maintained, including WFP's own programmes which offer a lifeline to almost 100 million vulnerable people globally.\n\nKEY DATA\n\nSome 265 million people in low and middle-income countries will be in acute food insecurity by the end of 2020 unless swift action is taken (source: WFP projection).\n\nThe majority of people suffering acute food insecurity in 2019 were in countries affected by conflict (77 million), climate change (34 million) and economic crises (24 million people). (source: Global Report on Food Crises).\n\n10 countries constituted the worst food crises in 2019: Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Ethiopia, South Sudan, Syria, the Sudan, Nigeria and Haiti. (source: Global Report on Food Crises).\n\nSouth Sudan had 61 percent of its population in a state of food crisis (or worse) in 2019. Six other countries also had at least 35 percent of their populations in a state of food crisis: Sudan, Yemen, Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Syrian Arab Republic and Haiti. (source: Global Report on Food Crises).\n\nThese ten countries accounted for 66 percent of the total population in Crisis or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) or 88 million people. (source: Global Report on Food Crises).\n\nWFP's Senior Economist, Arif Husain said:\n\n\"COVID-19 is potentially catastrophic for millions who are already hanging by a thread. It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage. Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock -- like COVID-19 -- to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe.\"\n\nINTERVIEWS\n\nWFP's Senior Economist and other senior staff available for interview -- please email WFP.Media@wfp.org\n\nWFP's Global Spokespeople available for interview, see here for full list of media contacts.\n\nMULTIMEDIA ASSETS\n\nVideo News Release on South Sudan and threat of COVID-19 available here.\n\nBroadcast quality footage on food crisis countries here.\n\nPhotos showing food crises countries and impact on COVID-19 available here.\n\nNOTE TO EDITORS\n\nThe Global Report on Food Crises, which is based on 2019 data, was released by a network of humanitarian and development partners, the Global Network Against Food Crises, of which WFP is a member.\n\nFull 2020 Global Report on Food Crises available here.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "News and Press Release in English on World about Food and Nutrition and Epidemic; published on 21 Apr 2020 by WFP", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/themes/custom/common_design_subtheme/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "News and Press Release in English on World about Food and Nutrition and Epidemic; published on 21 Apr 2020 by WFP", "og": {"site_name": "ReliefWeb", "type": "article", "url": "https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-taken", "title": "COVID-19 will double number of people facing food crises unless swift action is taken - World", "description": "News and Press Release in English on World about Food and Nutrition and Epidemic; published on 21 Apr 2020 by WFP", "image": "https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/reports/ca/76/ca760d6f-5daf-3f9c-bc4e-1f910e702553.jpeg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1916193535375038}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@reliefweb"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "canonical_link": "https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-will-double-number-people-facing-food-crises-unless-swift-action-taken"}
