The percentage of people who think it\u2019s getting better is increasing, from 9 percent in the first survey, up to 26 percent this week.\n\nIn that same time, where over 5,000 travelers form 17 countries were polled, the percentage of people who think the global situation as it pertains to international travel is getting worse is reducing: 74 percent in Week 1, compared to 45 percent this week. The percentage of people who believe the situation is remaining the same has increased from 10 to 19 percent; those who \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d have remained steady at 10 percent.\n\nThere\u2019s more confidence in domestic travel. The percentage of travelers who feel the domestic situation is getting better has increased from 8 to 35 percent. In fact, four of the top five searches from April 4 \u2013 12 in the U.S. were domestic (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Honolulu). London was the sole international destination.\n\nWith this said, global and domestic travel risk perception is slowly reducing but remains high; however, the risk of domestic travel is perceived to be lower than global travel. People\u2019s optimism about traveling later this year remains stable but is higher for domestic travel than global travel.\n\nIn the U.S., 74 percent of travelers are confident it\u2019ll be safe to travel internationally again in six months. Other destinations, including Brazil, Australia, Japan and South Korea, have much less confidence, with percentages ranging from 38 to 56 percent. In Europe, travelers in Germany and the Netherlands are on par with those in America. As for domestic travel, destinations across the board are more confident, with 61 to 91 percent of travelers being confident that it\u2019ll be safe to travel domestically again in six months.\n\nSource: www.partners.skyscanner.net\n\nRelated Stories\n\nStats: Worldwide, People Are Eager to Travel but Show Caution\n\nPassport Online Reports Spike in Online Activity in March 2020\n\nStats: Nearly All Safari Operators See 75% Decrease in Bookings\n\nMMGY: \u201cLight at the End of This Tunnel\u201d Can Be Seen", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Safety While Traveling", "Travel Industry Research", "Travel Industry Trends and Research", "Coronavirus", "Skyscanner", "Travel Agent Central Homepage", "Your Business"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Matt Turner"], "publish_date": "Tue Apr 21 13:11:09 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "According to the fourth weekly survey by Skyscanner, more and more people are seeing the global situation as it pertains to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic as", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud1/TACfavicon-32x32.png?VersionId=o9gcHXSDQbJ.dmkFB76q0VwTN4D.GetW", "meta_data": {"description": "According to the fourth weekly survey by Skyscanner, more and more people are seeing the global situation as it pertains to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic as", "keywords": "Safety While Traveling,Travel Industry Research,Travel Industry Trends and Research,Coronavirus,Skyscanner,Travel Agent Central Homepage,Your Business", "og": {"site_name": "Travel Agent Central", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.travelagentcentral.com/your-business/stats-travelers-more-optimistic-see-global-situation-improving", "title": "Stats: Travelers More Optimistic, See Global Situation Improving", "description": "According to the fourth weekly survey by Skyscanner, more and more people are seeing the global situation as it pertains to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic as | More and more people are seeing the global situation as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic as one that\u2019s getting better.
