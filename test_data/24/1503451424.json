Emphasising that the risk to the public remained low, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said: Scotland is well prepared for these types of outbreaks \u2013 we have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and the UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for the new virus. I am being kept fully informed about the precautionary steps being taken, including timely updates on the patients who are currently being tested. Share Updated at 18.03 CET\n\n24 Jan 2020 17.25 CET Here are some details of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is saying about the second case of coronavirus identified in the United States. The patient returned to the US from Wuhan on 13 January 2020, and called a healthcare provider after experiencing symptoms a few days later. The patient was admitted to a hospital, where infection control measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals. The patient remains hospitalised in an isolation room in stable condition and is doing well. Based on the patient\u2019s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed the infection. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are investigating locations where this patient went after returning to Illinois and are identifying any close contacts who were possibly exposed. The patient has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well and who will be monitored for symptoms. Since returning from China, the patient has had very limited movement outside the home. The CDC added that while it considered coronavirus \u201ca serious public health threat\u201d the immediate health risk to the US public was considered low. Share Updated at 17.36 CET\n\n24 Jan 2020 16.56 CET Hannah Devlin A crucial question for how the outbreak will unfold is how contagious the virus is. Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out. An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February. The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China. The analysis assumes that only 5% of infections in Wuhan have been identified, which would imply a far larger pool of people whose symptoms have been mild and who have not attended hospital. So while more people may have been infected than initially thought, on the positive side, it would imply that the majority of infections do not cause severe symptoms.

Traditionally, hundreds of millions of people gather around their televisions to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a more-than-four-hour showcase of skits, music and dance that has been a TV staple since the first edition was broadcast in 1983. This year an extra segment was added at the last minute to what is normally a carefully planned show, slotted in early in the broadcast. The hosts offered their best wishes to medical staff on the frontlines and to the people of Wuhan. \u201cWe will definitely be victorious!\u201d the hosts announced in unison. After a montage showing doctors and nurses in their hospitals donning protective gear and hard at work looking after their patients, the hosts read out further exhortations. Bai Yansong, one of state television\u2019s best-known anchors, told the gala the virus segment had been prepared very shortly before the actual show. \u201cRemember that we love you, not just today but every day in the future,\u201d Bai said as the camera cut to an audience member with tears streaming down her face. Bai\u2019s colleague Kang Hui, who often reads the main evening news, said the whole nation was involved in the virus fight. \u201cThere is no predicament we cannot get over,\u201d Kang said, to stirring music against a backdrop of more scenes of medical workers in protective body suits. Share Updated at 17.40 CET\n\n24 Jan 2020 16.46 CET Here is the full statement by the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, in which he said the risk to the UK public remained low: COBR (Cobra) met today to discuss the situation in Wuhan, China, and elsewhere in Asia. I updated on the current situation, the preparedness of the NHS, and possible next steps. I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage. We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases. We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease. The UK has access to some of the best infectious disease and public health experts in the world. There are no confirmed cases in the UK to date. We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan, China, since the beginning of the outbreak and are now implementing our planned response. A public health hub will be set up in Heathrow from today. This consists of clinicians and other public health officials, in addition to existing port health measures. The World Health Organization has rightly responded quickly and China has introduced strong public health measures.
