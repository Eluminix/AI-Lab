At the worst of times ... well, it\u2019s best not to speak of it. If all you\u2019ve ever heard about male toys is horror stories about Fleshlights, though, there are better options out there. Do yourself a favor and try out these toys that are worth using.\n\nTenga Egg\n\nA sex toy has to provide some new, improved sensation that goes above and beyond what you can get with your hands alone. On that front, the Tenga Eggs nail it. Not only are these one of the best options, but they\u2019re one of the least expensive. You can try out a single egg for a measly $7 or go for the six pack if you\u2019re feeling more confident. Each egg is compact but stretchy, and there are six different varieties of internal ridges and textures that provide unique sensations.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest of all, while they can be cleaned for a few reuses, they\u2019re designed to be disposable. Now, personally, I think if you\u2019re willing to make a mess, you should be man enough to clean up after yourself. But for a few bucks a pop, you can toss the whole egg and save yourself the hassle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one might seem like something you can use with a partner, but in my experience they can be just as fun when riding solo. Ostensibly, the point of a cock ring is to restrict the flow of blood from the penis, helping you to maintain an erection for longer. I\u2019m ... not totally sure how effective they are at that? Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend them for that reason alone.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are a handy way to strap a small vibrating motor to your equipment, though. And those can be fun. Fancy versions exist with rechargeable motors, but you can get an inexpensive models like this one give you two small bullet vibes. One goes underneath, one sits on top (where it\u2019s more likely to benefit your partner, if we\u2019re honest), and work together to create a satisfying sensation. Best of all, they don\u2019t get in the way of using your hands if you want to stick to your usual pattern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one isn\u2019t for everyone. And that\u2019s okay. But it\u2019s time to talk about penetration. Yes, guys can receive it, too. No, it doesn\u2019t \u201cmake you gay\u201d if it feels good. And yes, it is a different sensation than you might be used to, but it can be really fun! There are a lot of nerve endings in and around your anus.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, the prostate is most easily accessible from just inside the anus. Prostate massagers\u2014or, let\u2019s be a bit more frank here, vibrating dildos for men\u2014are designed to stimulate the prostate internally which can feel amazing. Some also come with a portion that can stimulate your perineum (the area between your anus and balls) as well. Which, if you\u2019ve never played around in that area, you\u2019re welcome.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one isn\u2019t really \u201cfor men\u201d so much as just ... get lube. Have some on hand. Use it. Use plenty. Don\u2019t be stingy.\n\n", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Sex toys", "Prostate massage", "Dildo", "Sexual acts", "Anal eroticism", "Prostate", "Human sexuality", "Cock ring", "Tenga", "Behavior", "The Inventory"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed May 13 21:30:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "At the best of times, sex toys designed for men can be a little awkward.
