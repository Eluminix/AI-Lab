He also visited Huoshenshan, one of the hospitals that was rapidly constructed to tackle the outbreak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChinese health authorities first reported that there were pneumonia cases in Wuhan, Hubei province in December to the World Health Organization. By the latest count, the province has reported a total of at least 67,760 cases (link in Chinese) and 3,024 deaths. Xi\u2019s visit comes as China has been reporting a steadily falling number of confirmed cases and deaths in the last two weeks. Only 19 new cases, of which 17 were in Wuhan, were reported yesterday.\n\nBeijing has signaled confidence in its fight against the epidemic by allowing cities outside Hubei to resume work and production. The government is also projecting that confidence overseas through a propaganda campaign that attempts to re-frame China as the global leader in the fight against the epidemic, and dispelling the narrative that the Covid-19 outbreak began in China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill Bishop, an analyst who writes the China-focused Sinocism newsletter, wrote earlier that the surest signs that the Communist Party \u201cthinks victory really is at hand\u201d are if Xi visits Wuhan, kids go back to school, and a new date is set for the delayed \u201cTwo Sessions\u201d political meetings, originally slated to take place this month.\n\nPrior to today\u2019s visit, Xi had been under fire for his lack of public appearances as the epidemic raged. His deputy, Li Keqiang, visited frontline workers and residents in Wuhan in January, while vice premier Sun Chunlan has been leading the government\u2019s response to the crisis in Hubei. Xi did not make his first public appearance until Feb. 10, when he visited a residential community in Beijing, though state media had been cultivating the image of the leader as a sort of behind-the-scenes commander of the country\u2019s efforts against the outbreak.\n\nWith public anger over the government\u2019s management of the epidemic still palpable, Xi\u2019s visit is likely to be conducted in a tightly controlled fashion. Just five days ago, angry residents in a Wuhan residential complex chanted \u201cit\u2019s all fake!\u201d from their windows during Sun\u2019s inspection of the neighborhood.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Quartz"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 10 05:59:40 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After a prolonged absence from the public eye, the Communist Party is now using the Chinese leader's visit to signal its confidence that it has defeated the epidemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_80,q_80,w_80/4716932d29f4ef6064940c18eaab1f3d.png", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW, max-image-preview:large", "description": "After a prolonged absence from the public eye, the Communist Party is now using the Chinese leader's visit to signal its confidence that it has defeated the epidemic.", "og": {"title": "Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Wuhan sends a clear message: China has defeated the coronavirus", "description": "After a prolonged absence from the public eye, the Communist Party is now using the Chinese leader's visit to signal its confidence that it has defeated the epidemic.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/054aa7790c31e6c88af2cefa0d5f5d59.jpg", "url": "https://qz.com/1815533/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Quartz", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_80,q_80,w_80/4716932d29f4ef6064940c18eaab1f3d.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,q_80,w_200/4716932d29f4ef6064940c18eaab1f3d.png", "keywords": "Quartz", "news_keywords": "Quartz", "fb": {"app_id": 602231513195606}, "twitter": {"url": "https://qz.com/1815533/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "qz", "title": "Xi Jinping\u2019s visit to Wuhan sends a clear message: China has defeated the coronavirus", "description": "After a prolonged absence from the public eye, the Communist Party is now using the Chinese leader's visit to signal its confidence that it has defeated the epidemic.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/054aa7790c31e6c88af2cefa0d5f5d59.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-10T05:59:40.093Z"}}, "canonical_link": "https://qz.com/1815533/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak"}
