Similarly, the broader Nifty closed at 11,993.05, falling by 233.60 points, or 1.91%.\n\nOn the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%, followed by SBI, IndusInd Bank, Maruti, HDFC, Hero MotoCorp, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries. Bucking the broader trend, only Titan and PowerGrid ended with gains.\n\nDomestic market witnessed intense selloff in line with global stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Iran of major retaliation if Tehran carries out any attack against America to avenge the killing of top military commander Qasem Soleimani and hinted at striking its cultural sites. His statement came hours after Iran announced it will no longer abide by the limits contained in the 2015 landmark nuclear deal.\n\nHe also threatened to impose \u201cvery big sanctions\u201d on Iraq if it follows through on a parliament vote calling for the expulsion of US troops based in the country.\n\n\u201cIndian market is reacting more negatively than other emerging markets due to crude oil impact. Since our dependence on crude imports as a percentage of consumption is the highest, the impact on economy and markets is also higher,\u201d said Rusmik Oza, Sr. VP (Head of Fundamental Research-PCG), Kotak Securities. \u201cAlong with crude, the negative impact of currency is also weighing on Indian markets.\u201d\n\nBrent crude oil futures surged nearly 2% to $69.81. The Rupee depreciated 24 paise against the U.S. Dollar to 72.04 (intra-day).\n\nBourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended lower. European markets were also trading in negative terrain in early sessions.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["sensex", "nifty", "stock market", "sensex today", "sensex january 6 2020", "sensex drops", "788 pts drop"], "tags": ["Hindi Belt", "Monkeypox", "Spotlight", "Good Health Hunting", "Live Now", "ISRO", "stocks", "stock exchanges", "Decode Karnataka", "Question Corner", "Data Point Podcast", "stock activity", "Ground Zero", "Live news", "Between Wickets", "Focus Tamil Nadu"], "authors": ["Authors"], "publish_date": "Mon Jan  6 12:02:52 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thehindu.com/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Sensex nosedives 788 points on U.S.-Iran standoff", "description": "On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%", "publish-date": "2020-01-06T17:32:52+05:30", "created-date": "2020-01-06T17:32:52+05:30", "modified-date": "2020-01-06T17:32:57+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2020-01-06T12:02:52.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-01-06T12:02:57Z", "section": "Markets", "tag": "788 pts drop", "author": "PTI"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 61648146, "thg-articleid": 61648146, "thg-articletype": "story", "title": "Sensex nosedives 788 points on U.S.-Iran standoff", "description": "On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sensex-nosedives-788-points-on-us-iran-standoff/article30494261.ece", "app_name": "The Hindu", "package": "com.mobstac.thehindu"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "PTI", "title": "Sensex nosedives 788 points on U.S.-Iran standoff", "description": "On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%", "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/business/markets/ouax62/article30494260.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/BSESENSEX", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.mobstac.thehindu", "iphone": 771672321}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Hindu (Official App)", "ipad": "The Hindu", "iphone": "The Hindu for iPhone"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindu.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindu", "site": "@The_Hindu"}, "keywords": "sensex,nifty,stock market,sensex today,sensex january 6 2020,sensex drops,788 pts drop", "news_keywords": "sensex,nifty,stock market,sensex today,sensex january 6 2020,sensex drops,788 pts drop", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "Sensex nosedives 788 points on U.S.-Iran standoff", "description": "On the Sensex chart, Bajaj Finance was the top loser, dropping 4.63%", "image": {"identifier": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/business/markets/ouax62/article30494260.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/BSESENSEX", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sensex-nosedives-788-points-on-us-iran-standoff/article30494261.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Hindu"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=771672321, app-argument=https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sensex-nosedives-788-points-on-us-iran-standoff/article30494261.ece", "google-signin-client_id": "853251516072-1eudfpp9hhjtjp31fpm8g9fus3ig0ec3.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "jlS-WsOVad-iw4X4xO0EJnHuzr3pK7WqXt3oCy7jpXI", "msvalidate": {"01": "00762243DAFA333A5A6D97CE4545BDB2"}, "yandex-verification": "ff4648e5089d361d", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 163974433696568}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sensex-nosedives-788-points-on-us-iran-standoff/article30494261.ece"}
