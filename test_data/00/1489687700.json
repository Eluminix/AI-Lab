In 2011, he was found guilty of embezzlement and misuse of public funds during his time as mayor of Paris.\n\nSarkozy stands accused of seeking to obtain, through his lawyer Thierry Herzog, classified information from then-judge Gilbert Azibert in 2014 about an investigation.\n\nLast June, appeals judges rejected a challenge against the case filed by Sarkozy, Herzog and Azibert.\n\nSince losing to the Socialist party\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and leaving office, Sarkozy has fought a barrage of corruption and campaign financing allegations, all of which he rejects.\n\nLast October, a court ruled he must stand trial for illicit campaign financing \u2013 a charge for which he risks a one-year jail term and a fine. Prosecutors say Sarkozy spent nearly \u20ac43m (\u00a336m) on his failed 2012 re-election bid \u2013 almost double the legal limit of \u20ac22.5m \u2013 using fake invoices.\n\nHe said he was unaware of the fraud by executives at the public relations firm Bygmalion, who are among 13 others being pursued in the case.\n\nSarkozy has also been charged over accusations he accepted millions of euros from the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi towards his first presidential campaign in 2007.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  8 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sarkozy is accused of trying to obtain classified information from a judge in 2014", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Sarkozy is accused of trying to obtain classified information from a judge in 2014", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303218acc7faecfbcc6e21ed2e5eb906ff307b2b/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=11c4ba478c187f8ee918638b4eb4ceda", "height": 720}, "title": "French ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy to stand trial in October", "description": "Sarkozy is accused of trying to obtain classified information from a judge in 2014", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Agence France-Presse", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2020-01-08T17:35:01.000Z", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-08T15:05:02.000Z", "tag": "Nicolas Sarkozy,France,Europe,World news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303218acc7faecfbcc6e21ed2e5eb906ff307b2b/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=783b646b192240c254c6a143e45c4991", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/08/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-to-be-tried-on-graft-charges"}
