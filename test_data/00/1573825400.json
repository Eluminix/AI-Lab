The ritual re-enacts Jesus' washing the feet of his 12 Apostles at their last supper before he was crucified.\n\n\n\nThe pope began his off-the-cuff homily by honoring the memory of priests who gave their lives in service to others, singling out those who died after tending to sick people in Italy\u2019s hospitals. Italy has the world\u2019s highest death toll from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese days, more than 60 in Italy have died, after giving attention to the sick in hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso doctors, nurses. They are the saints next door.\u201d\n\n\n\nLooking weary and speaking in a subdued voice, Francis also expressed dismay that priests have been insulted or slandered because of scandals in the Catholic Church involving pedophile members of the clergy.\n\n\n\nAddressing his remarks to priests worldwide, Francis said: \u201cToday I carry you in my heart and I carry you to the altar.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Ugly things are said to (many priests), in reference to the drama we have experienced with the discovery of priests who did ugly things,'' the pope said. \u201cSome tell me they cannot leave their home wearing the clerical collar because they\u2019re insulted.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier in the week, Australia's highest court dismissed the convictions of Cardinal George Pell for allegedly sexually abusing children. A former top papal aide, Pell spent 13 months in prison in his native Australia. Francis didn't mention him or cite a specific case in his remarks.\n\n\n\nFrancis said, speaking of priests, bishops and himself: \u201cDon\u2019t forget to ask forgiveness and learn to forgive.\"\n\n\n\nHoly Week ceremonies leading up to Sunday's Easter Mass have been badly disrupted by the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\n\nThe torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at Rome's Colosseum on Good Friday is a traditional highlight that normally draws large crowds of pilgrims, tourists and Romans. But this year, like all public religious gatherings in locked-down Italy, it has been canceled.\n\n\n\nInstead of presiding over the procession at the ancient arena, Pope Francis will lead the Good Friday ritual, which recalls the suffering of Jesus before and during his crucifixion, in a night-time ceremony closed to the public in St. Peter\u2019s Square.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords":
