The \u201conly way forward for the [WHO] is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\n\u201cIf the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,\u201d he said in the letter posted on Twitter.\n\nThis is the letter sent to Dr. Tedros of the World Health Organization. It is self-explanatory! pic.twitter.com/pF2kzPUpDv \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 19, 2020\n\nTrump suspended the US\u2019s contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak. Officials at the United Nations health agency have denied the accusations and China says it has been transparent and open.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his letter, Trump listed what he said were examples of the WHO\u2019s shortcomings in managing the pandemic, including ignoring early reports of the emergence of the virus.\n\nHe accused the UN body of caving in to Chinese pressure by declining to declare the new coronavirus a global health emergency in the initial days of the outbreak. He went on to criticise the WHO for praising China\u2019s \u201ctransparency\u201d, despite reports Beijing had punished several doctors in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, for speaking out about the viral infection in late December.\n\nBitter dispute\n\nThe US and China are locked in an increasingly bitter dispute about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people and brought the global economy to a standstill. Critics say Trump who had earlier praised China\u2019s response, is trying to divert attention from his handling of the pandemic in the US, which has suffered by far the highest death toll.\n\nThe WHO has now bowed to calls from most of its member states to launch an independent probe into how it managed the international response to the pandemic. The probe is expected to shed light on the origins of the virus and China\u2019s early handling of the outbreak.\n\nDuring a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019s annual assembly earlier on Monday, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the assembly he welcomed calls for a review.\n\n\u201cWe all have lessons to learn from the pandemic. Every country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience. WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement,\u201d Tedros said.\n\nThe review must encompass responsibility of \u201call actors in good faith\u201d, he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he also emphasised that the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a global health emergency on January 30, its highest level of alert, at a time when there were fewer than 100 cases outside of China. In the following weeks, the WHO warned countries there was a narrowing \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to prevent the virus from spreading globally.\n\nThe WHO declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on March 11, after the virus had killed thousands globally and sparked large epidemics in South Korea, Italy, Iran and elsewhere.\n\n\u2018Wake-up call\u2019\n\nThe agency\u2019s seven-member internal oversight body also issued its first report of the organisation\u2019s pandemic response on Monday, saying the WHO had \u201cdemonstrated leadership\u201d in handling the pandemic between January and April.\n\nThe report backed a probe into the global response, but said conducting it during the heat of the pandemic \u201ccould disrupt WHO\u2019s ability to respond effectively\u201d.\n\nThe panel also defended the organisation, saying \u201can imperfect and evolving understanding\u201d is not unusual during the early phase of a novel disease\u2019s emergence and, in an apparent rejoinder to Trump, said \u201crising politicisation of pandemic response\u201d was hindering the effort to defeat the virus.\n\nChina\u2019s President Xi Jinping, in a speech to the World Health Assembly on Monday, fiercely defended his country\u2019s response to the outbreak, saying: \u201cAll along we have acted with openness and transparency and accountability.\u201d\n\nXi also pledged $2bn over two years to help with the COVID-19 response and said any vaccines developed against the disease by China would be made for the public good.\n\nAntonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, called for greater unity and solidarity, saying the COVID-19 crisis should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have seen some solidarity, but very little unity, in our response to COVID-19. Different countries have followed different, sometimes contradictory, strategies and we are all paying a heavy price,\u201d he said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["News", "Coronavirus pandemic", "Donald Trump", "World Health Organization", "United States", "US & Canada"], "tags": ["Explained", "Human Rights", "Donald Trump", "Science & Technology"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Trump tells WHO chief he will reconsider US membership unless health agency demonstrates independence from China.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon_aje.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "Trump tells WHO chief he will reconsider US membership unless health agency demonstrates independence from China.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "user": {"signinStatus": "Signed Out", "verificationStatus": "Not Verified"}, "topics": "News", "primaryTopic": "News", "where": "United States, US & Canada", "tags": "Coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump, World Health Organization", "primaryTag": "Donald Trump", "keywords": "News, Coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump, World Health Organization, United States, US & Canada", "taxonomyTerms": "News, Coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump, World Health Organization, United States, US & Canada", "publishedDate": "2020-05-19T06:59:39", "lastDate": "2020-05-19T07:01:02", "contentType": "post", "sourceTaxonomy": "Al Jazeera, News Agencies", "pageTitle": "Trump threatens permanent freeze on WHO funding", "postID": 1099071, "postLink": "/news/2020/5/19/trump-threatens-permanent-freeze-on-who-funding", "articleSlug": "trump-threatens-permanent-freeze-on-who-funding", "source": "Al Jazeera,News Agencies", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/19/trump-threatens-permanent-freeze-on-who-funding", "title": "Trump threatens permanent freeze on WHO funding", "site_name": "Al Jazeera", "description": "Trump tells WHO chief he will reconsider US membership unless health agency demonstrates independence from China.", "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1fd54efb5aaf437eb3c25db227580939_18.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 5536782, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/19/trump-threatens-permanent-freeze-on-who-funding", "title": "Trump threatens permanent freeze on WHO funding", "description": "Trump tells WHO chief he will reconsider US membership unless health agency demonstrates independence from China.", "image": {"src": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1fd54efb5aaf437eb3c25db227580939_18.jpeg?resize=1200%2C675", "alt": "Trump threatens permanent freeze on WHO funding"}}, "pageSection": "News,Coronavirus pandemic,Donald Trump,World Health Organization", "pageType": "Article Page", "taxonomy-tags": "News, Coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump, World Health Organization", "channel": "aje", "ga4": "G-XN9JB9Q0M1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1534955972"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/5/19/trump-threatens-permanent-freeze-on-who-funding"}
