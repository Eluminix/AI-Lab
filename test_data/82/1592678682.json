Or, if they so prefer, they can request an in-person or telephonic appointment through the patient\u2019s portal at https://www.quironsalud.es/portal-paciente/es.\n\nRemember, the Accident & Emergency Service is available 24 hours, 365 days a year, except for the Alicante Centre, where the General and Paediatric Accident & Emergency Service opening hours are from 8 to 22 hours, Monday through Sunday.\n\nFor consultations related to coronavirus symptoms, patients can call the free telephone numbers provided by the Valencian Community Healthcare Department [Consejer\u00eda de Sanidad de la Comunidad Valenciana]: 900 300 555.\n\nAbout Quir\u00f3nsalud\n\nQuir\u00f3nsalud is the largest hospital group in Spain, and the third in Europe.
