You can\u2019t have free and open discussions if you\u2019re under duress,\u201d Na\u2019moks, who also goes by John Ridsdale, said.\n\nThere are an additional 13 house chief positions below the clan chiefs, although some are vacant and it remains unclear if they would meet without the clan chiefs present.\n\nNa\u2019moks said he\u2019s not concerned that the chiefs might miss a window of opportunity for dialogue with the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here for thousands of years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their timeline, it\u2019s not ours.\u201d\n\nCoastal GasLink could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nRCMP said in a statement Tuesday the force is aware of the request for a small mobile detachment to leave a remote area of British Columbia and discussions are underway on next steps.\n\nThe detachment is where Mounties recently arrested 28 people when officers enforced an injunction on behalf of Coastal GasLink.\n\nMost officers have left the area since the RCMP said its major operations in the region had concluded, but they\u2019ve said the mobile unit would remain in place and they\u2019ll continue \u201cpatrols of the corridor to ensure everyone\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nSaskatchewan Premier Scott Moe convened a conference-call meeting with other premiers Wednesday and said afterwards they are asking to meet with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about the ongoing blockades.\n\nMoe said in a statement the premiers discussed the impacts of the blockades on their respective jurisdictions and economies.\n\nThey want to meet with Trudeau on Thursday via teleconference to discuss paths to a peaceful resolution and an end to the blockades.\n\nTrudeau and his cabinet have rejected demands from conservatives on Parliament Hill and in provincial legislatures to break up the blockades by Indigenous protesters and their supporters as pressure on the Liberals to solve the crisis continues to mount.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Bill Blair said Wednesday the government won\u2019t issue an ultimatum to remove the blockades.\n\nStory by Amy Smart, The Canadian Press", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs", "rail blockades", "Wet'suwet'en"], "authors": ["Chek News", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 19 23:59:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Canada's minister in charge of Indigenous relations is making a bid to meet with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs, but with the First Nation's leadership en route to meet supporters outside British Columbia, the likelihood of such a meeting seems bleak.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cheknews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-CHEK-Mark-512x512-1-200x200.png?crop=1", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Canada's minister in charge of Indigenous relations is making a bid to meet with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs, but with the First Nation's leadership en route to meet supporters outside British Columbia, the likelihood of such a meeting seems bleak.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Federal, B.C. ministers 'available' to meet Wet'suwet'en chiefs but chiefs won't be there", "description": "Canada's minister in charge of Indigenous relations is making a bid to meet with Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs, but with the First Nation's leadership en route to meet supporters outside British Columbia, the likelihood of such a meeting seems bleak.", "url": "http://cheknews.ca/federal-b-c-ministers-available-to-meet-wetsuweten-hereditary-chiefs-but-chiefs-wont-be-there-648066/", "site_name": "CHEK", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/cheknews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CoastalGasLink.jpg?fit=713%2C396&ssl=1", "width": 713, "height": 396, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cheknews", "published_time": "2020-02-19T23:59:46+00:00"}, "author": "CHEK News", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CHEK_News", "site": "@CHEK_News"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.152.1", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CHEK", "application-name": "CHEK", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/cheknews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-CHEK-Mark-512x512-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "canonical_link": "https://cheknews.ca/federal-b-c-ministers-available-to-meet-wetsuweten-hereditary-chiefs-but-chiefs-wont-be-there-648066/"}
