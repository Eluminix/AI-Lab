Bolton, who acrimoniously left the White House a day before Trump ultimately released the Ukraine aid on Sept. 11, has already told lawmakers that he is willing to testify, despite the president\u2019s order barring aides from cooperating in the investigation.\n\nDemocrats need at least four Republicans to vote with them to seek witness testimony. Those prospects looked unlikely in recent days and it\u2019s unclear if the new revelations about Bolton\u2019s book will sway any GOP senators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemocrats quickly sought to ramp up the pressure on their Republican counterparts.\n\n\u201cJohn Bolton has the evidence,\u201d tweeted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cIt\u2019s up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump\u2019s actions testify in the Senate trial.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press has not confirmed the content of Bolton\u2019s book. A person familiar with the matter told the AP the draft had been submitted to the White House for pre-publication review, which is standard for the work of former officials with security clearances. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject.\n\nDemocrats accuse Trump of abusing his power in withholding the military assistance to Ukraine to push that country to mount investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukraine gas company, Burisma, while his father was in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Saturday, the president\u2019s attorneys said during their opening day of defense arguments that there was no evidence that Trump made the military aid contingent on the country announcing an investigation into Biden.\n\nTrump on Wednesday told reporters in Davos, Switzerland, that he didn\u2019t want Bolton to testify before the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe problem with John is it\u2019s a national security problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it\u2019s not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard. It\u2019s going to make the job very hard.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Health & Wellness", "Water & Drought", "Election 2024", "Arts", "Mexico & the Americas", "Plants", "Things to Do", "Israel-Hamas", "California Politics", "Contributors", "Mental Health", "Stand-Up Comedy", "Fashion", "Immigration & the Border", "For Subscribers", "Editorials", "Trump Administration", "L.A.
