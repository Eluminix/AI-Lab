with communist party hailing its efforts as major victory.\n\nThe downward trend in China has been celebrated by the government as a major victory.\n\nBeijing had initially concealed the outbreak

appreciated the robust containment measures arguing that those heavy quarantine restrictions came at a cost.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Sarah Clarke has more from Hong Kong.", "keywords": [],
