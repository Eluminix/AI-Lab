All told, 753,280 people lost their jobs in the seven-week period.\n\nThe loss of jobs last month was nine times greater than in April 2009 when the swine flu pandemic was in full swing and just over 60,000 people were laid off.\n\nAlmost 106,000 jobs were lost in Mexico City last month, Nuevo Le\u00f3n shed 53,000 and 45,000 disappeared in Quintana Roo. Between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs were lost in seven states: Jalisco, M\u00e9xico state, Guanajuato, Baja California, Veracruz, Sinaloa and Quer\u00e9taro.\n\nData also shows that 2.2% fewer formal sector workers are registered with IMSS than a year ago, the biggest annual decline since 2009. States that are heavily dependent on tourism recorded the biggest year-over-year employment declines.\n\nFormal sector jobs fell by 18.1% in Quintana Roo, 10.8% in Baja California Sur and 6.3% in Guerrero. Only six of Mexico\u2019s 32 states \u2013 Tabasco, Campeche, Michoac\u00e1n, Colima, Chiapas and Aguascalientes \u2013 recorded employment increases in the year to the end of April.\n\nThe construction and mining sectors have recorded the biggest job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic, IMSS data shows, but both were declared essential on Tuesday, meaning that workers who were laid off could be soon rehired.\n\nIn addition to the job losses, IMSS reported that the number of companies on its books decreased by almost 7,000 in April compared to the month before.\n\nAnalysts at Banorte said in a note that most businesses \u201cprobably suspended work or closed completely\u201d due to the coronavirus pandemic and consequent economic downturn.\n\nDavid Kaplan, a senior labor market specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank, said it is likely that there will be more job losses this month but predicted that the number won\u2019t be as high as in April.\n\nJesuswaldo Mart\u00ednez, a researcher at the Senate\u2019s Belisario Dom\u00ednguez Institute, said that further job losses in May are inevitable but he too predicted that they won\u2019t be as high as those seen last month.\n\nBy the end of the year, about 1 million people registered with IMSS will have lost their jobs, he said, predicting that if GDP falls by more than 7% this year, the hit to employment will be even greater.\n\n\u201cThe International Monetary Fund says there could be 1.5 million [job losses], including people in the informal sector,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said.\n\nSource: El Financiero (sp)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Mnd Staff"], "publish_date": "Wed May 13 20:46:39 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "According to the Mexican Social Security Institute, 198,033 jobs were lost between March 13 and 31 and a record 555,247 disappeared in April.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Favicon-MND-300x300.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "According to the Mexican Social Security Institute, 198,033 jobs were lost between March 13 and 31 and a record 555,247 disappeared in April.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "In a month and a half, 753,000 formal sector jobs lost due to coronavirus", "description": "According to the Mexican Social Security Institute, 198,033 jobs were lost between March 13 and 31 and a record 555,247 disappeared in April.", "url": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/753000-formal-sector-jobs-lost-due-to-coronavirus/", "site_name": "Mexico News Daily", "image": {"identifier": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/waiters-1.jpg", "width": 850, "height": 497, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mexiconewsdaily", "published_time": "2020-05-13T20:46:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-11-18T19:16:23+00:00"}, "author": "MND Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mexicond", "site": "@mexicond", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "MND Staff", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-Favicon-MND-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/753000-formal-sector-jobs-lost-due-to-coronavirus/"}
