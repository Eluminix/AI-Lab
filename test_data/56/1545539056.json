The ESA is instead exploring the possibility of an online event.\n\nMicrosoft, one of few supporters of this year's show, had big plans for E3, calling it a \"milestone year\" for Xbox. Following today's news, head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, announced that Xbox will now host its own digital event.\n\nSpencer did not say whether said event would run around the same time its E3 press conference would have, promising more news in the coming weeks.\n\n\"E3 has always been an important moment for Team Xbox,\" Spencer wrote on Twitter. \"Given this decision, this year we'll celebrate the next generation of gaming with the Xbox community and all who love to play via an Xbox digital event. Details on timing and more in the coming weeks.\"\n\nE3 has always been an important moment for Team Xbox.
