globally in the new coronavirus outbreak passed 3,000 today, as China reported 42 more deaths.\n\nThe new fatalities were all in the virus epicentre Hubei province, the National Health Commission said, bringing the overall toll in mainland China to 2,912.\n\nHealth officials also reported the lowest daily tally of fresh infections since late January, with 202 new cases.\n\nIn China, the number of reported new cases has gradually been declining, and there were only six confirmed new infections outside Hubei.\n\nThe virus emerged late last year in Hubei in central China, but has now spread to more than 60 countries around the world.\n\nThe United States and Australia reported their first fatalities over the weekend, while infections nearly doubled in the past 48 hours in Italy, Europe's hardest-hit country.\n\nThe World Health Organisation said yesterday that the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness.\n\nThe agency noted that most people with the Covid-19 illness only experience mild symptoms, while around 14 percent suffer severe disease like pneumonia and five percent become critically ill.\n\nIt said the mortality rate in the outbreak appears to be between two and five per cent.\n\nThe seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1 per cent but is highly infectious, with up to 400,000 people worldwide dying from it each year.\n\nOther strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), have established mortality rates of 9.5 per cent and 34.5 per cent, respectively. \u2014 AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Global", "coronavirus", "death", "toll", "passes", "3", "000", "with", "new", "China", "count"], "tags":
