This may be one of the strangest things I've ever seen... \u2014 Doug Black Jr (@dougblackjr) January 22, 2020\n\nBut behind closed doors - where the media is not allowed - senators have been flouting the quaint guidelines of the chamber that typically prizes decorum.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGum-chewing, snacking, yawning and alleged napping could be seen throughout the cramped chamber, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSenators were especially restless Wednesday, local time, as lawmakers convened less than 12 hours after the marathon session that stretched to nearly 2 am.\n\nA number of senators were seen resting their eyes, dozing and appearing to take brief naps, according to CNN and the Associated Press.\n\nA cartoonist for the New York Times observing the proceedings even managed to sketch Republican senator James Risch dozing off.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, were seen passing notes and doing crosswords while senators were speaking.\n\nNYT has a sketch artist covering impeachment, catching moments like Sen. Risch sleeping https://t.co/kXf9Voi0Og pic.twitter.com/fH5fee7In4 \u2014 Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) January 22, 2020\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the affair, admonished senators as tensions rose on Wednesday, local time, reminding those gathered it is the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest deliberative body,\u201d functioning, for now, as a court of impeachment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt has a tradition of civility \u2014 and for rare impeachment trials, specific rules: No coffee or snacking on the floor. No pacing, note-passing, working on other matters or chit-chat. It\u2019s all designed to focus the senator-jurors on the issues at hand. So napping is not, in theory, part of the plan.\n\nA number of senators also left the chamber during the opening days, some to conduct lengthy TV interviews, leaving a number of seats empty, AP reported.\n\n9- As the night wore on, senators were restless. Some walked to the back of the chamber and stretched. Sen. Gillibrand took off her heels, sighed then wrapped herself in a red blanket at her desk. Both her &McConnell started to doze off before jolting themselves back awake \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) January 22, 2020\n\n\u2018Its not fantasy football\u2019\n\nIn the opening two days of proceedings, the two sides have been wrangling over rules for the trial and who will be allowed to testify.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans shot down, one by one, Democratic efforts to get Trump aides to testify, including former national security adviser John Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nBolton has referred to the White House's alleged political pressure on Ukraine as a \"drug deal\", according to previous witness testimony in the House of Representatives.\n\nTrump returns to the White House Wednesday, local time, after attending Davos. Source: AAP\n\nTrump is charged with abusing his power by trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rival and leading Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled US Senate has voted on party lines to approve the rules for President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, rejecting Democratic efforts to obtain evidence and ensure witnesses are heard.\n\nTrump\u2019s Republican allies in the Senate say the son of Joe Biden, Hunter, should testify after Trump accused the former vice president of pursuing his son's interests by pressuring Ukraine to oust a prosecutor that had scrutinised a Ukrainian gas company. No evidence of wrongdoing by Biden has emerged.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTop Democrat Chuck Schumer hosed down the idea of a witness trade, telling reporters during a break in the trial \u201cthat trade is not on the table\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis isn't like some fantasy football trade,\u201d he said. \u201cTrials aren't trades for witnesses.\u201d\n\nSenator Adam Schiff and feloow Democrats talk to reporters before the second day of the Senate impeachment trial. Source: Getty\n\nDemocrats will continue their arguments through Friday under rules approved by the Senate.\n\nTrump's lawyers will then have up to three days to rebut the Democrats' case, likely starting from Saturday.\n\nThe lead Democratic prosecutor and California congressman Adam Schiff, urged Republicans to vote to remove Mr Trump from office to \"protect our democracy\".\n\n\"President Trump solicited foreign interference in our democratic elections, abusing the power of his office to seek help abroad to improve his re-election prospects at home,\" he said overnight.\n\n\u2014 With AP\n\nDo you have a story tip?
