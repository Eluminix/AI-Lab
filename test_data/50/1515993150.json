So the ban on travellers from Hubei province is extended to these two provinces with immediate effect,\u201d she said after attending the Malaysian Chinese Muslim Association (MACMA) Chinese New Year celebration at a shopping mall here today.\n\nIn Kulai, Johor, Deputy Education Minister Teo Nie Ching said all teachers and students who have just returned from China must undergo 14 days of home quarantine to check the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cTeachers and students who went to China recently whether for holidays or a visit must quarantine themselves at home.\n\n\u201cUpon returning, health screening must be done (and) even if they do not display any symptoms, they must be under home surveillance for 14 days and must not go to school,\u201d she told reporters after opening an event here.\n\nTeo said the education ministry has also decided to defer registration of students from China at local educational institutions until further notice.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["ban", "china", "coronavirus", "jiangsu", "travellers", "zhejiang"], "tags": ["China", "ban", "Zhejiang", "Jiangsu", "Travellers", "coronavirus"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Sun Feb  9 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This is in addition to the ban on arrivals from Wuhan and Hubei province.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=4, viewport-fit=cover", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1", "googlebot-news": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "application-name": "Free Malaysia Today", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "This is in addition to the ban on arrivals from Wuhan and Hubei province.", "author": "Bernama", "keywords": "ban,china,coronavirus,jiangsu,travellers,zhejiang", "category": "Highlight,Malaysia,Top News", "fb": {"pages": 323440711827, "app_id": 193538481218906}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2020/02/09/govt-bars-visitors-from-zhejiang-and-jiangsu-provinces/", "site_name": "Free Malaysia Today | FMT", "title": "Govt bars visitors from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces", "description": "This is in addition to the ban on arrivals from Wuhan and Hubei province.", "locale": {"identifier": "en_MY", "alternate": "en_JP"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/student-walking-mask-coronavirus-bernama-090220-1-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/student-walking-mask-coronavirus-bernama-090220-1-1.jpg", "type": "image/webp", "width": 800, "height": 500, "alt": "Free Malaysia Today"}}, "article": {"author": "Bernama", "section": "Highlight", "tag": "ban,china,coronavirus,jiangsu,travellers,zhejiang", "published_time": "2020-02-09T05:35:06Z", "modified_time": "2020-02-09T08:39:52Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@fmtoday", "url": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2020/02/09/govt-bars-visitors-from-zhejiang-and-jiangsu-provinces/", "title": "Govt bars visitors from Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces", "description": "This is in addition to the ban on arrivals from Wuhan and Hubei province.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/student-walking-mask-coronavirus-bernama-090220-1-1.jpg", "alt": "Free Malaysia Today"}, "creator": "Bernama", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Bernama"}, "google-signin-client_id": "348104539542-743ibtl8hdd5h0k3hqcakt03cmvcoplv.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2020/02/09/govt-bars-visitors-from-zhejiang-and-jiangsu-provinces/"}
