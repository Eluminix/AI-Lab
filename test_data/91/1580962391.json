Three more will be installed on Wednesday in strategic, high-traffic areas.\n\nShe said that the tunnels were purchased from a company named Water Drop with an investment of 600,000 pesos (US $25,000).\n\nAllende Mayor Patricia Salazar also installed a disinfection tunnel in her city on Monday.\n\nMonterrey Mayor Adri\u00e1n de la Garza installed a similar tunnel at the Municipal Palace so that all government employees and citizens who enter to carry out official business can pass through it for protection.\n\nAuthorities in other states, including Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Chihuahua and Tabasco, have expressed interest in the system.\n\nSource: El Universal (sp)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cody Copeland"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 31 23:40:48 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Three Nuevo Le\u00f3n municipalities have begun installing inflatable disinfection tunnels in strategic points to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Favicon-MND-300x300.jpg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Three Nuevo Le\u00f3n municipalities have begun installing inflatable disinfection tunnels in strategic points to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Disinfection tunnels installed in 3 Nuevo Le\u00f3n municipalities", "description": "Three Nuevo Le\u00f3n municipalities have begun installing inflatable disinfection tunnels in strategic points to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19.", "url": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/disinfection-tunnels-installed-in-3-nuevo-leon-municipalities/", "site_name": "Mexico News Daily", "image": {"identifier": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tunnels-1.jpg", "width": 850, "height": 522, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mexiconewsdaily", "published_time": "2020-03-31T23:40:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-11-18T19:13:50+00:00"}, "author": "Cody Copeland", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mexicond", "site": "@mexicond", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Cody Copeland", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cropped-Favicon-MND-270x270.jpg"}, "canonical_link": "https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/disinfection-tunnels-installed-in-3-nuevo-leon-municipalities/"}
