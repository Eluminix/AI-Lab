But that has not stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency and some countries from urging their citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.\n\nOpen Books, a non-profit bookstore in Chicago, sent an email to customers last week asking individuals not to use cash. A chain of diners in Washington State has also stopped accepting cash. And delivery services like Grubhub, Door Dash, and others have instituted \u201cno contact\u201d deliveries, and have either stopped offering cash as a payment option or are actively discouraging it.\n\nExperts say cash does carry a risk of transmitting the virus, but the risk from cash so far is small compared with other transmission routes. A scientific paper published early in the outbreak found the virus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. The researchers, however, did not test whether it can live on banknote paper.\n\nThe presence of live virus particles on banknotes does not mean they are a health hazard, public health experts said. Virus particles are unlikely to return to the air, or aerosolize, once on a surface.\n\nDon't miss out on what's happening!

Credit and debit cards are made of plastic and metal. ATMs are touched by hundreds of human hands a day. And there have been studies that show smartphones are heavily contaminated with bacteria because of their constant use.\n\nEven the Federal Reserve has taken efforts to make sure the money supply is not contaminated. Banknotes that circulated in Europe and Asia are being quarantined for seven to 10 days as a \u201cprecautionary measure,\u201d according to a Federal Reserve spokesperson.\n\nWhile businesses are discouraging cash usage, there have been reports of customers making large withdrawals from ATMs in several parts of the country. Some banks have had to order additional cash from the Fed or keep ATMs stocked at higher levels to allow larger customer withdrawals.\n\nBanknote avoidance is not just happening in the U.S. In South Korea, which has been more successful in stemming the outbreak, the country\u2019s central bank took all banknotes out of circulation for two weeks or, in some cases, burned paper money.\n\nIran is suffering the worst outbreak of the virus in the Middle East. Using cash there is common, but in recent weeks many people have avoided it and banks have announced that they will not accept cash from customers. Iranians often have multiple debit cards but cash is widely used in small-scale transactions, like buying bread in bakeries or leaving a tip. Many people have started even being careful in how they hand over debit cards, as contactless payment methods haven\u2019t caught on there.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Coronavirus Outbreak", "Coronavirus Outbreak National"], "tags": ["Coronavirus Outbreak", "Columnist", "Crime in Hawaii", "Coronavirus Outbreak National", "Business", "National News", "World News", "Entertainment", "Russia Attacks Ukraine", "Maui Fires", "Red Hill Water Crisis", "Recipes", "America in Turmoil", "Politics"], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 19 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paper money being shunned for fear of coronavirus spread | Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "description": "NEW YORK >> In a world suffering a pandemic, cash is no longer king.", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/03/19/breaking-news/paper-money-being-shunned-for-fear-of-coronavirus-spread/", "site_name": "Honolulu Star-Advertiser", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/web1_AP20079673462215.jpg", "width": 760, "height": 509, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/staradvertiser/", "published_time": "2020-03-20T04:50:00+00:00"}, "author": "Associated Press", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@staradvertiser", "site": "@staradvertiser", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Associated Press", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "keywords": "Coronavirus Outbreak, Coronavirus Outbreak National"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2020/03/19/breaking-news/paper-money-being-shunned-for-fear-of-coronavirus-spread/"}
