Priorities USA said it\u2019s considering expanding the campaign to other states as well.\n\nThe second TV ad, \u201cBetter Prepared,\u201d gives a glowing feel to expectations that Democratic rival former Vice President Joe Biden would provide leadership America could trust.\n\nTrump victory spokeswoman Emma Vaughn replied by saying that while Trump is saving American lives Democrats are playing politics.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has taken bold and decisive action that has undoubtedly saved American lives while Democrats in D.C. are playing political games holding up legislation that would help millions during these trying times. Democrats should put politics aside and come together for the sake of our country,\u201d Vaughn stated in a news release.\n\nAdditionally, Priorities USA is releasing two digital ads that will begin running on Tuesday across a variety of online platforms like Facebook and streaming TV.\n\nThese ads \u2014 \u201cMap\u201d and \u201cSteady Leadership\u201d \u2014 feature similar themes as their longer TV counterparts, contending that Trump refused to adequately prepare the country for the coming crisis and that Biden would provide a significant departure from the chaos.\n\nSince last week, Priorities has also been promoting news content to voters in critical battleground states painting Trump\u2019s coronavirus efforts as a failure to respond effectively to the mounting crisis.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, Donald Trump has repeatedly misled the American people and exposed us to unnecessary danger. His failure to lead continues to have real life and death consequences as hospitals, local and state governments, small businesses, and millions of Americans are left without the tools and information they need,\u201d Priorities USA Chairman Guy Cecil wrote in a news release. \u201cTens of thousands of people are sick, hundreds have already died, and millions are losing their jobs. We simply cannot allow Donald Trump to continue to lie and spread misinformation unchecked. The American people deserve the truth about their president.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Digital ads", "COVID-19", "president", "Priorities USA", "Donald Trump", "response", "TV commercials", "democrats", "new coronavirus", "Joe Biden", "2020 election", "campaign", "crisis"], "authors": ["Scott Powers"], "publish_date": "Mon Mar 23 22:40:29 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "TV commercials, digital ads hit Trump, promote Joe Biden.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/fpfavicon.png", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Fla_Pol", "site": "@Fla_Pol", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Scott Powers", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "og": {"title": "Priorities USA ads pound Donald Trump on coronavirus response", "type": "article", "url": "https://floridapolitics.com/archives/324754-priorities-usa-ads-pound-donald-trump-on-coronavirus-response/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "TV commercials, digital ads hit Trump, promote Joe Biden.", "site_name": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.
