The process differs from coronavirus tests that swab the nose and throat.\n\nThe results, while limited, back a popular belief among health experts that significantly more people have been infected than testing shows \u2014 due to some people being asymptomatic and to the country\u2019s limited testing capacity.\n\nDr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and ABC News contributor, cautioned that the results for the California county are not necessarily representative of the country\u2019s population \u2014 but he said the study is \u201cadding to this confirmation of what we\u2019ve expected, which is a much larger number of cases than we ever anticipated.\u201d\n\nA sweeping COVID-19 testing initiative on the Navy\u2019s coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found that 60 percent of its sailors who tested positive were asymptomatic.\n\nBut the link between a positive coronavirus antibody test and immunity is not yet clear.\n\nThe World Health Organization cautioned Friday that it\u2019s not yet known whether having survived the deadly virus brings a universal immunity to reinfection.\n\n\u201cThese antibody tests will be able to measure that level of serology presence, that level of antibodies, but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies\u201d is immune, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHO\u2019s emerging diseases unit.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["US News", "california", "Coronavirus"], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "california"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Fri Apr 17 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A recent study found that between 2.5 and 4 percent of participants had the antibodies that show they've recovered from COVID-19.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/themes/gtf/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
