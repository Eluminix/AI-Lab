The ranking highlights 100 companies demonstrating exceptional performance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices.\n\nJD.com is named to 2025 FORTUNE China\u2019s ESG Impact List on May 16\n\nA Benchmark for Employee Welfare and Social Responsibility\n\nFORTUNE China commended JD.com for setting industry-leading standards in workforce welfare, including being the first private enterprise in China to sign formal labor contracts and provide comprehensive social insurance and housing funds (\u201c\u4e94\u9669\u4e00\u91d1\u201d) to all frontline employees.\n\nIn 2024, JD further solidified its commitment to talent development by launching its largest-ever global campus recruitment drive, offering 18,000 positions with significantly enhanced compensation packages.\n\nThe company also unveiled two landmark projects: a 110,000-square-meter global training base in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, designed to accommodate over 2,000 trainees, and the first phase of \u201cJD Youth City,\u201d a residential complex offering nearly 4,000 fully furnished apartments for employees. Notably, JD reported zero violations in information security and privacy protection in 2024.\n\nLeading the Shift from \u201cE\u201d to Holistic ESG Progress\n\nFORTUNE China observed a broader trend among Chinese companies this year: a shift from prioritizing environmental (\u201cE\u201d) metrics alone to embracing a more balanced approach with social (\u201cS\u201d) and governance (\u201cG\u201d) initiatives. As industries grapple with diminishing returns from hyper-competition, businesses increasingly recognize that human capital, like natural resources, demands sustainable stewardship. Many are actively reducing overtime, enhancing benefits, and emphasizing employee well-being.\n\nJD.com exemplifies this evolution. With over 720,000 employees as of April 30, 2025, JD stands as a leading private employer model in China by embracing corporate responsibility. The company\u2019s \u201cPeople First\u201d philosophy extends beyond traditional logistics, now covering full-time food delivery riders with full social insurance and housing fund contributions\u2014a first in the industry in China. JD also assumes the riders\u2019 personal contribution share, ensuring financial security and dignity for this growing workforce.\n\nA Legacy of Promises Kept\n\nRichard Liu, JD.com\u2019s Founder and Chairman, reflected on a defining 2024 milestone: over 1,200 veteran delivery employees retired with comprehensive benefits, including steady monthly pensions, lump-sum housing fund withdrawals, and full medical coverage. \u201cIn 2007, when hiring our first delivery colleague, I pledged to secure their futures through comprehensive benefits. Today, that promise sustains tens of thousands of families,\u201d Liu shared in a March social media post, calling it his \u201cmost fulfilling achievement\u201d in 20 years of entrepreneurship.\n\nOn March 28, JD Food Delivery hosted a signing ceremony to welcome new full-time riders. This initiative aligns with JD\u2019s decade-long dedication to frontline employees, celebrated on April 28 at the 10th anniversary of its \u201cFrontline Workers Day.\u201d Originally to honor delivery personnel, the event now recognizes diverse roles, from riders and customer service representatives to housekeeping cleaners and more, reinforcing JD\u2019s mission to provide dignified, stable careers.\n\nIn December 2024, JD Logistics honored its courier Chen Haiyan with a retirement ceremony\n\nJD.com remains committed to the company\u2019s \u201cPeople First\u201d ethos, driving innovations in employee welfare and community impact. As the company grows, so does its resolve to empower every worker, ensuring not just livelihoods but brighter futures.\n\n(vivian.yang@jd.com)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Hui Zhang", "Vivian Yang"], "publish_date": "Wed Feb 12 05:29:28 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "JD.com had allocated around RMB 200 million to support the fight against the coronavirus, and the company continues to invest more daily.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://jdcorporateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-favicon-60x60.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "JD.com had allocated around RMB 200 million to support the fight against the coronavirus, and the company continues to invest more daily.", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "JD.com Has Allocated RMB 200 Million for Coronavirus Aid to Date - JD Corporate Blog", "description": "JD.com had allocated around RMB 200 million to support the fight against the coronavirus, and the company continues to invest more daily.", "url": "https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-has-allocated-rmb-200-million-for-coronavirus-aid-to-date/", "site_name": "JD Corporate Blog", "image": {"identifier": "https://jdcorporateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/\u5fae\u4fe1\u56fe\u7247_20200212120140-800.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 570, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-12T05:29:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-11-24T09:03:00+00:00"}, "author": "Hui Zhang", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Hui Zhang", "label2": "Estimated reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.151.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://jdcorporateblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cropped-favicon-300x300.png"}, "canonical_link": "https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-has-allocated-rmb-200-million-for-coronavirus-aid-to-date/"}
