And I hope we pass the test,\u201d she said. However, she ruled out following Austria\u2019s lead in banning visitors from Italy.\n\nIs Merkel\u2019s ideology endangering Germany during coronavirus outbreak?\n\nHer refusal to put in ban visitors from one of the worst-hit countries in the world follows comments she made just two days ago that she wanted to implement measures to \u201cbuy time\u201d in the fight against coronavirus, with \u201call measures\u201d being put in place to slow the spread of the virus. She said such measures could help give researchers time to conduct medical research and even create a vaccine, which would be important for next winter when the virus is expected to accelerate.\n\nDespite Merkel\u2019s claims of \u201csolidarity\u201d and \u201ccare for each other\u201d as the reason for maintaining and open border policy with Italy, other actions from her government seem to contradict her, including Germany\u2019s decision to block medical supplies to Italy, an action condemned by other EU members.\n\nItaly has 12,500 coronavirus cases and 826 deaths, and the country serves as the epicenter of coronavirus in Europe. Italy has banned travelers from a number of nations, including China and Iran in addition to implementing a nation-wide quarantine.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump implemented a total travel ban for travelers entering the U.S. from Europe yesterday, except for Great Britain. The move follows after his country became one of the first to ban travelers from China. Trump said during an address to the nation that if Europe had blocked travelers from China earlier, it may have avoided or at least slowed the transmission of coronavirus.\n\nGermany grapples with spread of virus\n\nCurrent data showed that Germany, with 1,966 confirmed cases of coronavirus and three casualties, was the world\u2019s seventh most affected country by the coronavirus outbreak, which has been now declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.\n\nMerkel also said she was open to scrapping Germany\u2019s \u201cblack zero\u201d rule to allow new government borrowing. She said it was \u201can extraordinary situation\u201d and that ending the outbreak came first.\n\n\u201cThe virus is in Germany, it is in Europe. That\u2019s the thought we have to get used to,\u201d Spahn said. \u201cIt will still spread even if you close all the borders. Sooner or later you have to let people in or out and then it starts spreading again.\u201d\n\nExperts estimate the virus\u2019s mortality rate in an advanced healthcare system like Germany\u2019s at between 0.1% and 0.7%, Spahn added. Though Germany has the most intensive care beds per capita in Europe, its healthcare system could quickly be overwhelmed if the virus spread too fast.\n\nInterviewed on Deutschlandfunk radio, Spahn said Germany\u2019s current priority was to slow the virus\u2019s spread to minimize the peak burden on the country\u2019s health system.\n\nTitle image: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (R) and Health Minister Jens Spahn (L) attend a news conference about the coronavirus outbreak in Germany, in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, March 11, 2020.
