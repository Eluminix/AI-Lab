Dhabi National Energy Company (Taqa), a leading integrated utilities firm in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, reported a revenue of Dh14.2 billion for the first quarter of 2025, marking a 3.8 per cent increase year-on-year.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;The growth was primarily fuelled by higher pass-through items in its Transmission and Distribution (T\u0026amp;D) segment, though net income dipped by 1.5 per cent to Dh2.1 billion due to commodity price volatility and declining oil and gas production. Ebitda also fell 6.7 per cent to Dh5.3 billion, yet the core utilities business provided stability amid these challenges.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;Taqa\u2019s Board approved an interim dividend of 0.75 fils per share, underscoring confidence in its financial resilience. The company is accelerating its global renewables expansion through its stake in Masdar while positioning itself to power the UAE\u2019s ambitious AI Strategy for 2031.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;Masdar, Taqa\u2019s renewable energy arm, made significant strides in Q1. Its Saeta Yield platform acquired the 243 MW Valle Solar project in Spain, and Masdar secured a deal to acquire a 49.99 per cent stake in four of Endesa S.A.\u2019s solar assets, totaling 446 MW, pending regulatory approval.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;In Abu Dhabi, Masdar is developing a pioneering 5.2 GW solar project with 19 GWh of battery storage, delivering 1 GW of continuous clean energy \u2014the world\u2019s first giga-scale \u201cround-the-clock\u201d renewables initiative.Post-quarter, TAQA signed a power purchase agreement with Emirates Water and Electricity Company (EWEC) for the 1 GW Al Dhafra Thermal plant, which will provide flexible, dispatchable capacity.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;Taqa Transmission is also investing in advanced grid infrastructure to integrate gas and renewable energy, supporting high-performance computing and digital infrastructure critical for AI. These projects, alongside Masdar\u2019s renewables initiative, require an estimated Dh36 billion investment in the coming years.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; Taqa Transmission expanded its international footprint by acquiring Transmission Investment (TI), a UK-based platform operating offshore transmission assets (OFTO) that connect wind farms to the grid and support subsea interconnectors. This acquisition strengthens Taqa\u2019s role in the global energy transition, enhancing its ability to deliver sustainable infrastructure.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp; The T\u0026amp;D segment led with revenues of Dh9.1 billion, Ebitda of Dh2.4 billion, and a net profit of Dh1.4 billion. The Generation business recorded revenues of Dh2.9 billion, Ebitda of Dh1.7 billion, and a net profit of Dh238 million. Taqa Water Solutions posted revenues of Dh636 million, Ebitda of Dh397 million, and a net profit of Dh167 million.

With Masdar\u2019s renewables expansion and key acquisitions, we are advancing the global low-carbon transition while aligning with the UAE\u2019s energy and AI goals,\u201d Thabet said.

The Indian expat (who wished to remain anonymous) said her company doesn\u2019t have a dedicated room or any spare place to pump and out of desperation  she \u0022had to do it in the office toilet which is an unhygienic place to pump milk\u0022.\u003C\/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe added, \u201cAll new mothers in my office are managing the same, pumping in toilets and it\u2019s just sad.

Though her parents are in the country, they don\u2019t live in Sharjah where she resides, making daily support difficult.
