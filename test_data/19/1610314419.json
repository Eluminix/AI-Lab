Those bars were so high that they affected only 0.3% of all ads, but, Google contended, such ads accounted for 27% of all ad-generated network traffic and 28% of all ad-related CPU usage.\n\nOther browsers have addressed bad actors, including crypto-miners, using different approaches. Mozilla\u2019s Firefox, for example, blocks crypto-miners by targeting domains known to harbor such scripts. (Mozilla relies on domain lists produced by Disconnect.) It\u2019s not surprising that Google took a metrics-based route here; it typically bases decisions, or says it does, on data collected by Chrome and/or its search engine.\n\nChrome users can try out this \u201cHeavy Ad\u201d detection and removal prior to version 85 via the chrome://flags option page. Set the Heavy Ad Intervention flag (which also goes by #enable-heavy-ad-intervention) to Enabled and relaunch the browser.\n\nSite developers and ad content creators should use the time between now and late August to test and, if necessary, alter first-party advertisements, Google said. \u201cOur intent with this extended rollout is to give appropriate time for ad creators and tool providers to prepare and incorporate these thresholds into their workflows,\u201d said Vale.\n\nDetailed instructions on how to track removed ads using an API as well as how to test the resource usage of ad content were provided in this support document.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["More This Author", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The company said only 0.3% of all ads online disproportionately account for a big chunk of total network and CPU consumption.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.computerworld.com/wp-content/themes/cw-b2b-child-theme/src/static/img/cw/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "category": "Browsers, Enterprise Applications", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, index,follow", "twitter": {"label1": "Written by", "data1": "gregg keizer", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes", "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619215/chrome-85-to-erase-ads-that-hog-network-cpu-resources.html", "site": "Computerworld", "title": "Chrome 85 to erase ads that hog network, CPU resources", "description": "The company said only 0.3% of all ads online disproportionately account for a big chunk of total network and CPU consumption.", "image": "https://www.computerworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/online-ads-ad-blocker-100667955-orig.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.6.2", "msapplication-TileColor": "#9a99eb", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "displaytype": "article", "source": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619215/chrome-85-to-erase-ads-that-hog-network-cpu-resources.html", "date": "May 18, 2020", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619215/chrome-85-to-erase-ads-that-hog-network-cpu-resources.html", "site_name": "Computerworld", "title": "Chrome 85 to erase ads that hog network, CPU resources", "description": "The company said only 0.3% of all ads online disproportionately account for a big chunk of total network and CPU consumption.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.computerworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/online-ads-ad-blocker-100667955-orig.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 576}}, "description": "The company said only 0.3% of all ads online disproportionately account for a big chunk of total network and CPU consumption."}, "canonical_link": "https://www.computerworld.com/article/1619215/chrome-85-to-erase-ads-that-hog-network-cpu-resources.html"}
