Following the inspection, during which CCCHD noted the many protective procedures implemented by Dole, the facility implemented additional protocols based on their suggestions to further increase the safety of our employees and contractors. These include greater distancing and separation of workers in our facility, table dividers installed in our cafeteria and similar dividers in our packing room for added protection.\"\n\n\n\nDespite implementing additional safety measures, 10 Dole salad plant employees and contractors at the Ohio packing plant tested positive for COVID-19, according to the statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe cannot state with certainty how the transmission occurred, but these results lead us to believe that the plant is not the source of transmission. No matter how the transmission occurred, however, Dole will continue to place employee health and well-being above all else in our efforts to keep fresh salads on shelves across the nation,\u201c the statement concluded.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Health", "Coronavirus", "News"], "tags": ["Future Forecaster", "FOX6 en Espa\u00f1ol", "Small Business", "FOX6 Cents", "Contact 6",
