During a press conference Tedros spoke of the abuse \u2014 including racial slurs \u2014 he had been subjected to since the public health crisis began. He largely avoided mentioning Trump by name but did single out the government in Taipei, which has been frozen out of the WHO after political pressure from Beijing. \u201cThree months ago, this attack came from Taiwan,\u201d he told reporters in Geneva, referring to online criticism and insults. \u201cTaiwan, the Foreign Ministry also, they know the campaign. They didn\u00b4t disassociate themselves. They even started criticising me in the middle of all that insult and slur, but I didn\u00b4t care,\u201d Tedros said. The comments sparked anger in Taiwan, which described Tedros\u00b4 comments as \u201cbaseless\u201d. \u201cOur country has never encouraged the public to launch personal attacks against him or made any racially discriminatory comments,\u201d foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told reporters on Thursday. The ministry added it was seeking an apology for \u201cslander\u201d. In a Facebook post, President Tsai Ing-wen invited Tedros to visit Taiwan and learn from its handling of the epidemic, challenging him to \u201cresist pressure from China\u201d. \u201cWe have been blocked from international organisations for many long years and we know what it feels like to be discriminated against and isolated more than anyone else,\u201d she said.\n\nRelations between the WHO and Taiwan have worsened considerably since the pandemic began, even as health experts have lauded Taiwan for its response to the virus. It has just 380 confirmed COVID-19 patients and five deaths despite its close proximity and trade links with China, where the pandemic began.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Taipei: Taiwan demanded an apology Thursday from the World Health Organization chief after he accused the island\u00b4s government of leading personal attacks against him and his agency\u00b4s...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "TITLE": "Taiwan demands apology from WHO chief over virus \u2018slander\u2019 | World | thenews.com.pk", "description": "Taipei: Taiwan demanded an apology Thursday from the World Health Organization chief after he accused the island\u00b4s government of leading personal attacks against him and his agency\u00b4s...", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Taiwan demands apology from WHO chief over virus \u2018slander\u2019", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg", "description": "Taipei: Taiwan demanded an apology Thursday from the World Health Organization chief after he accused the island\u00b4s government of leading personal attacks against him and his agency\u00b4s...", "url": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/642026-taiwan-demands-apology-from-who-chief-over-virus-slander"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thenews_intl", "title": "Taiwan demands apology from WHO chief over virus \u2018slander\u2019", "description": "Taipei: Taiwan demanded an apology Thursday from the World Health Organization chief after he accused the island\u00b4s government of leading personal attacks against him and his agency\u00b4s...", "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/no-img-fb.jpg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The News International", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/front/img/tn-icons/144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/642026-taiwan-demands-apology-from-who-chief-over-virus-slander"}
