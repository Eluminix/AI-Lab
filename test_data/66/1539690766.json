In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity, Trump said he thinks the 3.4 percent figure is a \"false number.\"\n\n\"Public health experts have noted the WHO\u2019s estimate may change as more is learned about the spread of the virus; thousands of non-fatal cases likely have gone undetected,\" Kenen writes. \"But while the death rate may dip below 3.4 percent, everything that\u2019s known so far suggests it won\u2019t plummet to a level that\u2019s not alarming. And it\u2019s already hitting some populations, like the elderly, disproportionately hard.\" (It should be noted that Trump's questioning of the 3.4 rate was simply a reference to an opinion voiced by the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci.)\n\nWhen it comes to the outbreak's seriousness, White House officials \"have been all over the place,\" according to Kenen. \"The president has accused Democrats and the media of hyping the virus \u2014 one that\u2019s killed thousands worldwide \u2014 to hurt his reelection prospects, calling the criticism 'their new hoax,'\" he writes. \"And he\u2019s repeatedly hinted that a vaccine is coming soon, despite being told directly and repeatedly that in the most optimistic scenario it\u2019s at least a year away.\"\n\nExperts are calling the mixed messaging a \"communications nightmare\" for health officials, and making matters worse, that mixed messaging is coming from an administration that has a history of denying science -- and now thanks to Trump, they have to worry about how talking about the crisis will affect the stock market.\n\n\"Scientists who contradict Trump sometimes run into a buzz saw \u2014 or in the case of Trump\u2019s false predictions on Hurricane Dorian last fall, pressure to walk back the facts.\"\n\nRead Kenen's full piece over at POLITICO.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": ["Fox News"], "authors": ["Sky Palma", "D.
