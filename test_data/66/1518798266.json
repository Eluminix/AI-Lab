contract of digitisation of the city police's official records by the previous BJP government in Maharashtra, sources said on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, when Sanjay Barve was asked about it, he said the firm offered its services free of cost and there was no question of any financial gains to it.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe project of police records' digitisation was awarded to CrispQ Information Technologies Pvt Ltd for five years by the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government before the state Assembly polls were held in October last year, the sources said.\n\nThe company is owned by Barve's son Sumukh Barve and wife Sharmila Barve.\n\nThe firm sent a proposal on September 30, 2019 to the state government, offering its service \"pro bono\" (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) to provide paperless office system to the Mumbai Police through a software called 'Notesheet Plus', an official said.\n\nA copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), he said.\n\nRecords, complaints and service documents of the Mumbai Police personnel were to be digitised with the help of the specified software, the official said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe proposal was approved by the government as the company was going to do the work for free, and the Mumbai Police Commissioner's office was also directed to finalise the number of units and files for the digitisation work, the official said.\n\nHowever, the project did not start due to some technical issues, he added.\n\nWhen contacted, Sanjay Barve said, \"The company had offered its service 'pro bono' and it was for the benefit of the Mumbai Police.\"\n\nThe software, which was offered to be used by the company, is free and there is no question of any financial gains to the firm, he said.\n\nSanjay Barve is retiring from service on February 29.\n\nALSO READ | With people's blessings one can make comeback: Devendra Fadnavis\n\nALSO READ | Maharashtra to introduce bill to make
