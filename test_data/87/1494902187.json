The country is still considered the most fecund in Europe, according to the latest statistics in 2017, with 1.90 children per woman, but between 2006 and 2014, the average was 2 children per woman.\n\nThe report says that the fertility rate is now stabilising: 6,000 fewer births last year compares to 20,000 fewer in 2015.\n\nPopulation growth in 2019 reflects the same analysis as previous years \u2013 there are more babies born than migrants coming to France.\n\nAnd life expectancy is one of the highest in Europe, with 85.6 years for women, and 79.7 years for men. This, combined with the falling birth rate, means more than one out of five people in France is 65 or older.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The population of France surpassed 67 million as of 1 January 2020, but the growth was limited due to a continuous decline in the birth rate for the past five years, according to a report released by the French National Institute for Statistics and Studies (INSEE) this week .", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicons/apple-icon-180x180.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover", "description": "The population of France surpassed 67 million as of 1 January 2020, but the growth was limited due to a continuous decline in the birth rate for the past five years, according to a report released by the French National Institute for Statistics and Studies (INSEE) this week .", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@modernghanaweb", "domain": "modernghana.com"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1403992796296002, "pages": 366939671198}, "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Modern Ghana", "title": "French birth rate slows to lowest since WWII", "url": "https://www.modernghana.com/news/979093/french-birth-rate-slows-to-lowest-since-wwii.html", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/114202080742-l5hsk8v331-000_1az6ob_0.jpg", "description": "The population of France surpassed 67 million as of 1 January 2020, but the growth was limited due to a continuous decline in the birth rate for the past five years, according to a report released by the French National Institute for Statistics and Studies (INSEE) this week ."}, "theme-color": "#bb1919", "application-name": "Modern Ghana"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.modernghana.com/news/979093/french-birth-rate-slows-to-lowest-since-wwii.html"}
