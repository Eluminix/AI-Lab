I don't think it's the best of the recent DC films, but it's certainly plenty entertaining \u2013 and deserved a much better reception than it got in theaters. Now, Warner Bros. is gearing up to drop the movie onto digital early, and I'm hopeful more folks will discover it there. If you haven't seen it yet, and want some indication of the tone of the flick, you might want to check out the featurette above. It's pretty extensive \u2013 it runs a little over 8 minutes \u2013 and covers a lot of bases. Star Margot Robbie talks about how she pitched the entire idea for the film, and then met with screenwriter Christina Hodson about the project. From there we learn about Cathy Yan being brought on to direct the film, the casting, the action, and more. This is actually one of several features included on the home media release. Here's a full list of what else is included.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBirds Eye View Mode\n\nBirds of Prey: Birds of a Feather\n\nGrime and Crime\n\nWild Nerds\n\nRomanesque\n\nSanity is Sooo Last Season\n\nA Love/Skate Relationship\n\nGag Reel\n\nOn March 24, Birds of Prey will be available to own in high definition and standard definition from select digital retailers including Amazon, FandangoNOW, iTunes, PlayStation, Vudu, Xbox and others. And then on April 7, Birds of Prey will be made available digitally on Video On Demand services from cable and satellite providers, and on select gaming consoles.\n\nWhen Gotham's most nefariously narcissistic villain, Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), and his zealous right-hand, Zsasz (Chris Messina), put a target on a young girl named Cass (Ella Jay Basco), the city is turned upside down looking for her. Harley (Margot Robbie), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez)'s paths collide, and the unlikely foursome have no choice but to team up to take Roman down.\n\nAdvertisement", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Chris Evangelista"], "publish_date": "Sun Mar 22 16:00:51 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/slashfilm-favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/intro-import.jpg", "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "mrf": {"tags": "Content Type:Legacy Article;Primary Category:News;Category:News;Headline Approver:Unknown;Trello Board:Legacy"}, "og": {"site_name": "SlashFilm", "title": "'Birds Of Prey' Featurette: Go Behind-The-Scenes Ahead Of Next Week's Digital Release - SlashFilm", "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/intro-import.jpg", "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/573002/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/"}, "twitter": {"title": "'Birds Of Prey' Featurette: Go Behind-The-Scenes Ahead Of Next Week's Digital Release - SlashFilm", "description": "Go behind-the-scenes of Birds of Prey with a new featurette that's one of the special features included on the home media release.", "site": "@slashfilm", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/intro-import.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-22T16:00:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-03-22T16:00:51+00:00", "author": "Chris Evangelista"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/573002/birds-of-prey-featurette-new/"}
