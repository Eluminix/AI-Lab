Although the virus has been tough to cope with, I have managed to work remotely in LA and am improving every day,\" Shell wrote.\n\nShell took over from Steve Burke as NBCUniversal's CEO on Jan. 1.\n\nDisclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.\n\nWATCH: What investors should know about incoming NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["business news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Alex Sherman", "In Alex-Sherman"], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 26 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell said he has tested positive for COVID-19 in an e-mail to staff.
