Fourteen of the military members with COVID-19 are in Ontario and 22 are in Quebec.\n\nTrudeau said the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have both asked for the military to extend the deployment and he expects to agree. The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in both provinces, Trudeau announced Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, our women and men in uniform have been working to help the most vulnerable Canadians, as we deal with this pandemic. And as the need for their help continues, we\u2019ve received new requests to extend this period of deployment in both Ontario and Quebec. We will be following up,\u201d he said.\n\nHorrific conditions being exposed about several long term care facilities in Ontario amid this pandemic https://t.co/t20YWGorlq \u2014 Cormac Mac Sweeney (@cmaconthehill) May 26, 2020\n\nTrudeau said he spoke to Ontario Premier Doug Ford earlier in the morning and assured him the federal government will be there to support the province.\n\n\u201cWe need to do a better job of taking care of our elders in long-term care facilities in Ontario and, indeed, right across the country,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nHe also said that the problems uncovered by the military go beyond the facilities were members were stationed in Ontario and Quebec.\n\n\u201cThere are many, extraordinary, excellent long-term care facilities across this country,\u201d Trudeau added. \u201cThere are some that, obviously, are not doing as well, that we need to make sure we are improving the standards of care.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Cormac Macsweeney", "Richard Southern", "The Canadian Press", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width"], "publish_date": "Tue May 26 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec, according to the prime minister ahead of a damning report from the military regarding several long-term-care homes in the former.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/apple-touch-icon.png?v=2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec, according to the prime minister ahead of a damning report from the military regarding several long-term-care homes in the former.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Military report finds disturbing conditions in five Ontario care homes", "description": "The Canadian military will keep assisting in nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec, according to the prime minister ahead of a damning report from the military regarding several long-term-care homes in the former.", "url": "https://montreal.citynews.ca/2020/05/26/military-report-disturbing-ontario-care-homes/", "site_name": "CityNews Montreal", "image": {"identifier": "https://montreal.citynews.ca/wp-content/blogs.dir/sites/19/2020/05/JDT10258901.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 749, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CityNewsMTL/", "published_time": "2020-05-26T18:44:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-26T22:53:30+00:00"}, "author": "mikehall", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@citynewsmtl", "site": "@citynewsmtl"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "facebook-domain-verification": "6yh9bpys0s96wobzes7yxkmaf9iy3n"}, "canonical_link": "https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2020/05/26/military-report-disturbing-ontario-care-homes/"}
