Karate black-belt who resigned as deputy PM\n\n21 April 2023 Share Save Share Save\n\nPA Media\n\nDominic Raab has resigned as deputy prime minister, following an investigation into claims of alleged bullying.\n\nMr Raab, who was also the justice secretary, had always denied the allegations but said he would quit if bullying claims were upheld.\n\nHe has done that, but in his resignation letter to Rishi Sunak, and in an article penned for the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Raab also hit back.\n\nWhile the report from senior lawyer Adam Tolley KC makes uncomfortable reading in parts, Mr Raab - who's changed his Twitter handle to \"MP for Esher and Walton, father of two, boxing fan\" - has thrown a punch of his own.\n\nIn his letter to the PM, he said ministers needed to be able to give direct critical feedback and exercise direct oversight over their civil servant officials.\n\nHe apologised for any \"unintended\" stress caused, but referred to the \"pace, standards and challenge\" he brought to the Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe report cleared the former frontbencher of shouting and swearing at staff, and he was not found to have used physical gestures - but it did say that style of working as a minister was \"inquisitorial, direct, impatient and fastidious\".\n\nAnd it paints a picture of a man who worked from 7.30 in the morning until late at night and at weekends.\n\nMr Raab was found to have described the work of officials as \"utterly useless\" and \"woeful\" while he was justice secretary.\n\nAnd as foreign secretary, a role he served in from 2019 to 2021, the report says in one instance \"he acted in a way which was intimidating, in the sense of unreasonably and persistently aggressive conduct in the context of a work meeting. His conduct also involved an abuse or misuse of power in a way that undermines or humiliates.\"\n\nRaab basics\n\nUK Parliament/Jessica Taylor\n\n25 February 1974 (age 49)\n\nJob: Justice secretary, deputy prime minister, lord chancellor, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton\n\nEducation: Dr Challoner's Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities\n\nFamily: Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive, with two sons\n\nBefore politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague\n\nDespite resigning, Mr Raab is entitled to a pay-off of nearly \u00a317,000, a quarter of his ministerial salary, as long as he is not reappointed to another position within three weeks.\n\nBut the MP, who paid his own legal fees during the investigation, faces a pay cut of \u00a367,505 as he loses his ministerial salary. As an ordinary backbencher, he will earn \u00a386,584 a year.\n\nMr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938.\n\nHe was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his masters degree.\n\nHe worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve.\n\nFirst elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as \"obnoxious bigots\" in an online article also claiming men were getting \"a raw deal\".\n\nMrs May accused him of fuelling \"gender warfare\".\n\nMr Raab remained on the backbenches for five years after becoming an MP.\n\nBut the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron's general election victory in 2015.\n\nHe played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister.\n\nLeadership bid\n\nIn 2017, Mr Raab was branded \"offensive\" by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying \"the typical user of a food bank is not someone that's languishing in poverty; it's someone who has a cash flow problem\".\n\nBut in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior.\n\nIn Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government.\n\nAnd in July that year, when David Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post.\n\nYet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, arguing that he could not \"in good conscience\" support the \"backstop\" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nAs an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.\n\nAfter Mrs May announced she was standing down, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.\n\n'Get Brexit done'\n\nIn a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.\n\nMr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the race, promoted him to foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.\n\nBut he only narrowly managed to hold on to his Esher and Walton seat at the 2019 general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenge by 2,743 votes.\n\nThe overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to \"get Brexit done\", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January 2020.\n\nAs foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he was the UK government's de-facto second-in-command.\n\nHe was left in charge of running much of the government when the prime minister was hospitalised with Covid-19 in April 2020.\n\n'Take the knee'\n\nColleagues, including Mr Johnson's arch-critic and former aide Dominic Cummings, have praised Mr Raab's performance under extreme pressure.\n\nBut he has continued to anger opponents with some of his comments, in 2020 telling talkRadio's Julia Hartley-Brewer he would only \"take the knee\" - go down on bended knee - for \"the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me\".\n\nHe later qualified his remarks - following opposition criticism of his \"insulting\" and \"flippant\" tone - saying he \"fully\" supported the Black Lives Matter campaign.\n\nIn fact, some of his remarks and gaffes have resulted in mockery. Despite a reputation for being a creature of habit, he dismissed an eye-catching claim by a former diary secretary that he insisted on the same Pret A Manger lunch every day.\n\nAnd as Brexit secretary, he came under fire for saying he \"hadn't quite understood\" how reliant UK trade in goods was on the Dover-Calais crossing.\n\nAs foreign secretary, Mr Raab was heavily criticised for his handling of the aftermath of the fall of Afghanistan, specifically for remaining on holiday in Crete while the Taliban marched back to power.\n\nHe insisted he'd been across the detail and was in touch with the key players.\n\n'Electoral suicide'\n\nDowning Street stood by the minister, however he was later demoted to the role of justice secretary, which although still a cabinet position is not as prestigious as foreign secretary.\n\nMr Raab stayed publicly loyal to Mr Johnson, being one of the few ministers not to resign during the final chaotic week of his premiership.\n\nThe deputy party leaders swap exchanges on bullying claims against him and her previous labelling for her opponents.\n\nIn the leadership race that followed, he enthusiastically threw his backing behind Rishi Sunak - and in August fiercely attacked the rival candidate Liz Truss, calling her economic plans \"electoral suicide\".\n\nThat broadside wasn't forgotten by Ms Truss's team and Mr Raab was not included in her cabinet when she became prime minister.\n\nHowever, Ms Truss was soon gone and Mr Raab returned to government in the familiar roles of justice secretary and deputy prime minister.\n\nAs Mr Sunak's deputy, he stood in for his boss at Prime Minister's Question opposite Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy. Their exchanges across the despatch box were often fiery.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Conservative MP was a close ally of PM Rishi Sunak, but resigned after a bullying probe.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/apple-touch-icon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"title": "Who is Dominic Raab?
