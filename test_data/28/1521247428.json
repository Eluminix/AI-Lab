It wasn\u2019t an unexpected bouquet or a box of heart-shaped chocolates from a secret admirer, but a piece of art by the artist Banksy on the side of their building.\n\nThe work of art that now adorns a wall in Bristol, the home city of the artist known as Banksy, shows a stenciled girl firing an explosion of red flowers into the air using a slingshot. Kelly Woodruff, who co-owns the property had no idea her house had been hit by the artist until she was tagged in a photo on Facebook with someone asking if that was her house. \u201cAnd we were like, \u2018woah it is\u2019,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201cWe are super excited.\u201d\n\nThe pseudonymous artist confirmed the work was his by posting two images of it on his official Instagram account. Even before it was official, though, crowds had reportedly gathered to see what is now being called \u201cthe Valentine\u2019s Day Banksy\u201d.\n\nAmidst the hubbub, the home owner is now trying to figure out how to protect and preserve the valuable piece of art that is on the side of her house. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a handbook for these kind of scenarios,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201c[W]e\u2019ve never been in this situation so any advice is welcome.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The piece appeared on the side of a home in Bristol, Banksy's hometown", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#e90606", "description": "The piece appeared on the side of a home in Bristol, Banksy's hometown", "application-name": "nextgen", "author": "Melissa Locker", "creator": "Melissa Locker", "category": "Newsfeed", "fb": {"app_id": 991230477954201, "pages": 10606591490}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published_time": "2020-02-14T15:45:55"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5784376/banksy-valentines-day/", "description": "It was a surprise, as is to be expected", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bristol-banksy-valentines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "amphtml": "https://time.com/5784376/banksy-valentines-day/?amp=true", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"title": "There's Lots to Love In New Banksy Art That Popped Up on Valentine's Day", "description": "It was a surprise, as is to be expected", "url": "https://time.com/5784376/banksy-valentines-day/", "site_name": "TIME", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bristol-banksy-valentines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TIME", "title": "There's Lots to Love In New Banksy Art That Popped Up on Valentine's Day", "description": "It was a surprise, as is to be expected", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bristol-banksy-valentines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}}, "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5784376/banksy-valentines-day/"}
