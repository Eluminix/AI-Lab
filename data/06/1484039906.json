When her husband got home from work in the evenings, the four of them would go directly to the nearby park in their neighborhood in Tempe. Sometimes they\u2019d be there until 9 or 10 at night.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be inside the house, watching TV all day long,\u201d Sainz said. \u201cI want them to be outside, to keep their minds busy.\u201d\n\nAfter about a year and a half in Tempe, Sainz was pregnant with a third child. Her husband\u2019s commute from downtown Phoenix seemed to be getting longer. With a new baby on the way and two toddlers, she wanted the growing family to live closer to his work.\n\nThey moved to a neighborhood south of downtown. The house seemed perfect\u2014it was across the street from a park and near a daycare. But then Sainz\u2019s toddler started wheezing and coughing at night.\n\n\u201cIt was something that we\u2019d never seen before,\u201d Sainz said. \u201cWe were really panicked. We took her to the hospital the next day and the first question they asked me was, 'Does she have asthma or respiratory issues?' And I said no. They never linked it to the quality of the air.\u201d\n\nFor more stories that matter: Click here to subscribe to azcentral.com.\n\nSouth and west Phoenix have the worst air quality in the Valley. Maricopa County Air Quality Department uses monitors throughout the county to measure particulate matter, or PM, fine particles that are produced by vehicles, construction, industry, fireworks and wood burning.\n\nPM 2.5 are airborne particles small enough to enter the lungs and can trigger asthma attacks. Young children whose lungs are still developing, and elderly people with weakened lungs, are most at risk for health problems caused by PM 2.5. This dangerous fine particle pollution tends to increase during the holiday season as more people burn wood in fireplaces and outdoor pits, and set off fireworks to celebrate the new year.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS: Smelling smoke on a no-burn day? Here's why nobody gets fined\n\nWhen her daughter started wheezing, Sainz stopped taking her to the park. After spending as many as four hours outside playing, Sainz cut the time down to a half hour, then 15 minutes. Her daughter kept wheezing. Sainz downloaded air quality apps on her phone and signed up for alerts from Maricopa County, which issues no-burn days, and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), which puts out high pollution advisories. Enforcement by the county is often lax.\n\n\u201cMy life just changed right there,\u201d Sainz said, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cHow do you limit a kid from four hours to 15 minutes outside? My life depended on checking on apps before having my children go outside. The house becomes your safe zone from the outside. But at the same time, you see all these other children outside and it\u2019s like how do you communicate to them that this could happen to them as well?\u201d\n\nWhy pollution is worse in the winter\n\nThis time of year, early morning commuters may notice the sunrise muddied by a brown haze on the horizon. That\u2019s pollution, primarily particulate matter.\n\nFor most of the year, the sun heats the ground enough to warm the air just above it. That warm air gradually rises throughout the day, allowing pollution to disperse in a larger area.\n\nBecause the sun is weaker in the winter, cold air sits lower to the colder ground. Warmer air above it rises, but the cold air stays near the ground and doesn't mix with the rest of the atmosphere. The result is a line of brown haze trapped below the warm layer.\n\nCLOSE\n\nLocal winds are a factor too, shifting pollution to different parts of the Valley throughout the day and night, said ADEQ meteorologist Matthew Pace.\n\nIn the afternoon, the wind generally moves up the mountains surrounding Phoenix, pulling the air from the west and southwest toward the east and northeast. At night, cold air drains back to the south and southwest, eventually settling in the lowest point of the valley \u2014 near the Salt River in south and west Phoenix.\n\n\u201cAny of those pollutants that you create, whether it\u2019s PM 2.5, which is smoke, or PM 10, which is dust, that will all drain slowly down into the south part of the valley,\u201d Pace said.\n\nOnly rain or wind can disperse the cold air layer near the ground and allow the pollution to diffuse. Christmas Eve and Christmas Day were some of the cleanest days on record because of the rain and storm system that kept smoke from building up.\n\n\u201cEveryone's gotta do their part at this point to protect the entire population. Even if you're not sensitive to it, that smoke in your neighborhood is draining into someone else's neighborhood.\u201d Matthew Pace, ADEQ meteorologist\n\nSouth and west Phoenix are denser areas and tend to have more older homes with wood-burning fireplaces, another reason for higher particulate matter counts in those areas, said Ron Hope, an atmospheric scientist with Maricopa County. It\u2019s also a more industrial area than other parts of the city.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to quantify how much smoke from local burning in northern Phoenix is transferred to the south and west. Hope tracked pollution throughout a 24-hour period on a high pollution day in 2018 and found that the wind patterns had filtered most of the pollution from east and central Phoenix by midnight, but pollution remained high in west Phoenix.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the transport issue,\u201d Hope said. \u201cYou tend to have this airflow, especially after midnight, where the air will start to settle in the southwest. So you've got a lot of local burning in south and west Phoenix with fireplaces and bonfires and so forth, which makes pretty high concentrations that we see early in the evening. Then later on in the evenings, those concentrations will start to increase and that's because they're being compounded with transported smoke. A lot of the fires are out, but you have the firework smoke, the lingering smoke from the fireplaces, and it all starts to settle, especially in the southwest.\u201d\n\nADEQ issued a high pollution advisory for New Years Eve this year. On New Years Day 2018, PM 2.5 levels exceeded national standards, and were the highest they\u2019d been since the county started tracking particulate matter. On Christmas Day in 2017 and 2018, PM 2.5 levels also exceeded national standards.\n\n\u201cEveryone's gotta do their part at this point to protect the entire population,\u201d said Pace. \u201cEven if you're not sensitive to it, that smoke in your neighborhood is draining into someone else's neighborhood.\u201d\n\nMORE: No burning allowed on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day in Maricopa County\n\nHigh-poverty areas\n\nAir pollution exposure is closely linked to race and socioeconomic status. The north and northeast parts of metro Phoenix tend to be wealthier and whiter, with better air quality. The southern and western part of Phoenix tends to be poorer, predominantly minorities and has worse air quality, according to soon-to-be-published research by Darshan Karwat, an aerospace engineer and assistant professor in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society and the Polytechnic School at Arizona State University.\n\nKarwat layered demographics, air quality and transportation data on top of one another to understand the overlap between air pollution, socioeconomic status, race and age across the city. He gave each census tract an air pollution \u201cscore\u201d by combining distribution levels for certain pollutants governed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards: ozone, PM 10 and PM 2.5. Then he created color-coded maps to show the distribution.\n\nAir pollution in the Valley. (Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic)\n\nThe research was fueled by a desire to identify the places that face both poverty and poor air quality and then make contact with those people. He presented his findings at several community meetings in south and west Phoenix.\n\n\u201cLike in most cities, poor people, browner people are exposed to more air pollution in Phoenix,\u201d Karwat said. \u201cA lot of the air quality work has remained in the academic sphere and what we want to do is provide more access to this kind of knowledge to people who are affected by it.\u201d\n\nAsthma rates are some of the highest in the county in south and west Phoenix zip codes, according to 2017 data from the Maricopa County Department of Public Health.\n\nTopography isn\u2019t the only reason why air in south and west Phoenix is particularly bad during the winter. History sheds a light on why these areas are more polluted, poorer and primarily home to minorities.\n\nIn the late 1860s, white settlers established what would become modern Phoenix as an agricultural center by the Salt River. They used the remnants of the centuries-old canal system built by the Hohokam people to bring water to the arid region. At that time, Mexicans were largely excluded from jobs other than working as field hands. When the railroad was built in southern Phoenix, factories sprouted near the tracks and people of color lived nearby for work, as they were barred from other economic opportunity because of racist policies.\n\nDepression-era districting and zoning laws kept land values low in south Phoenix, allowing more industry to move in. After World War II, people of color were denied federal loan programs for low-interest mortgages. Thus, white people were able to move north, away from the factories, creating a growing suburban middle class in the northeast of the city, according to a paperpublished by Arizona State University researchers in 2005.\n\nBETTER BUSES: These student runners train in 'nasty air.' They're working to clean it up\n\nIn the 1960s, the freeway system was built parallel to the railroad corridor, followed by the construction and later expansion of Sky Harbor airport in the 1970s and 1980s. The environmental justice movement, which began in the 1980s, brought many of these issues to light as local activists protested for their rights.\n\nToday, the legacy of that history remains. Beatriz Beltran lives in south Phoenix, near the 17 freeway. Her daughter developed asthma when they moved from east Phoenix to south Phoenix.\n\n\u201cSometimes we smell gas, paint, oil,\u201d Beltran said. \u201cI hear a lot about allergies and asthma attacks. This is an issue that a lot of the Latino community has.\u201d\n\nSainz\u2019s old house was under the flight path from Sky Harbor airport. Her family eventually moved out of that area, but her daughter still wheezes when the air is bad.\n\n\u201cNot everyone has the privilege to move \u2014 what happens to the people who stay there?\u201d Sainz said. \u201cSomething happened that now I don't let my children go outside. As a mom, it\u2019s hard. I try to put them in activities, and all the activities are so expensive. So, who are the ones that get to do that? We go through so many things the wealthy don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nSainz has always been active in her community, but after her daughter started wheezing, she joined Moms Clean Air Force and Ecomadres. As part of those organizations, she hosts \u201ccafecitos,\u201d information sessions at schools and daycares about the climate crisis, air quality and other environmental issues. She helps plant trees in south Phoenix neighborhoods and advocates for clean climate policies at a local, state, and federal level.\n\n\u201cWe have so many other issues we have to fight every day with racism, with immigration,\u201d Sainz said. \u201cI see my community struggle. It comes to an environmental injustice. It's a fight that we're fighting right now.\u201d\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.
