He indicated that the goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.1\n\n\u201cThis is a historic breakthrough,\u201d Trump said.1 \u201cIt\u2019s been a very successful method of communication, but never used on [this large of a] scale.\u201d\n\nCMS Administrator Seema Verma said the \u201cdramatic expansion\u201d will benefit the 62 million beneficiaries across the country enrolled in Medicare. Previously, she said, full telehealth services were limited to patients who met certain criteria, including those mostly in rural areas of the United States who had difficulty accessing medical care. However, these services are now accessible in more homes and in a variety of care facilities.1\n\n\u201cThis is part of our larger effort around mitigation [of COVID-19],\u201d Verma said.1\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the CDC had 4226 reported cases in the United States and 75 deaths due to COVID-19. These cases included both confirmed and presumptive positive cases reported to the CDC or tested at a CDC site since January 21, 2020. The numbers do not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and Japan.2\n\nMedicare beneficiaries will be able to receive various services through telehealth, including common office visits, mental health counseling, and preventive health screenings.3 Verma said consultations with physicians can be made remotely, allowing patients to avoid leaving their homes and putting themselves at higher risk of contracting the virus. 1\n\nAn example of patients who can now benefit from telehealth services are those individuals with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, that require routine checkups.\n\n\u201cMedicare patients that don\u2019t absolutely need to come into an office, don\u2019t have to,\u201d Verma said.1\n\nClinicians can bill immediately for dates of service starting March 6, 2020. Telehealth services are paid under the Physician Fee Schedule at the same amount as in-person services. Medicare coinsurance and deductibles still apply for these services, according to CMS. Additionally, there is flexibility for health care providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal health care programs.3\n\nAccording to Trump, regarding Medicare\u2019s telehealth services, no penalties will be pursued under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act during the COVID-19 pandemic. No additional costs to patients are expected.1\n\nREFERENCES", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["coronavirus", "payer", "retail", "HSE", "telehealth"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kristen Coppock", "Ma", "Managing Editor"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients.", "og": {"url": "https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/medicare-expanding-telehealth-services-to-all-beneficiaries-amid-covid-19-pandemic", "title": "Medicare Expanding Telehealth Services to All Beneficiaries Amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmacytimes/1219c69fc57a78245722b0e5e5c97141876a8772-644x390.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format", "site_name": "Pharmacy Times", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Medicare Expanding Telehealth Services to All Beneficiaries Amid COVID-19 Pandemic", "image": "https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/pharmacytimes/1219c69fc57a78245722b0e5e5c97141876a8772-644x390.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format", "site": "@@Pharmacy_Times", "description": "The goals of the expansion are to maintain social distancing and to avoid overburdening hospitals with patients."}, "robots": "max-video-preview:-1", "keywords": "coronavirus,payer,retail,HSE,telehealth", "next-head-count": 14}, "canonical_link": "https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/medicare-expanding-telehealth-services-to-all-beneficiaries-amid-covid-19-pandemic"}
