And I think part of the magic ingredient of their growth had to do with constant innovation in product, breaking boundaries in terms of distribution models.\n\n\"[But] I had a yearning and a need to create my own company.\"\n\n[My business] is really based on a whole new paradigm: that people have moved more to direct-to-consumer marketing; that millennials and generation Z are consuming beauty products in a very different way, through storytelling, and through digital marketing. People are embracing the idea of scent very differently.\n\n\"I saw the whole rise of artists, brands, and social media.\"\n\nThe fact that very small companies came out of nowhere, entering the social media world and creating a retail platform to sell products \u2014 a light bulb went off in my head, and I said, 'Oh, this would be a great forum to create very interesting brands in fragrance where we are simply partnering with new brands.'\n\n\"I admire micro-influencers because they're very much motivated by a pure desire of expressing themselves.\"\n\nYou can make an argument that macro-influencers have become highly sought after revenue models for many companies. So, in this context, I'd say one of the beauties of micro-influencers is that when, if they decide they want to create a fragrance with us, we know that they are completely passionate about doing this \u2014 not just to make money, but to actually reach their fan base. And very often you'll see that micro-influencers have a much higher degree of engagement and following than a macro-influencer does.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Dominic-Madori Davis"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Steve Mormoris, formerly an executive at beauty giant Coty, is hoping to partner with \"different artists who express themselves in an olfactory way.\"", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png?v=2023-11", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "THE STYLE SERIES: This entrepreneur is trying to disrupt the fragrance industry by tapping into e-commerce and DTC brands \u2014 and he's already got pop icon Cher on board", "datePublished": "2020-01-31T22:05:00Z", "dateModified": "2020-07-03T14:54:29Z", "news_keywords": "Lifestyle, Entertainment, Retail, Arts & Culture, Retail, Fashion", "description": "Steve Mormoris, formerly an executive at beauty giant Coty, is hoping to partner with \"different artists who express themselves in an olfactory way.\"", "author": "Dominic-Madori Davis", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Lifestyle", "og": {"title": "THE STYLE SERIES: This entrepreneur is trying to disrupt the fragrance industry by tapping into e-commerce and DTC brands \u2014 and he's already got pop icon Cher on board", "description": "Steve Mormoris, formerly an executive at beauty giant Coty, is hoping to partner with \"different artists who express themselves in an olfactory way.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/scent-beauty-interview-ceo-coty-inc-alum-steve-mormoris-2020-1", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5e34a44b5bc79c16856ddc18?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"ga1": "va", "zpd-job": "c", "vvhp": "v"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5df003b5fd9db22aca5feca2", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Lifestyle", "tags": "Page Type:slideshow"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2023-11", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/scent-beauty-interview-ceo-coty-inc-alum-steve-mormoris-2020-1"}
