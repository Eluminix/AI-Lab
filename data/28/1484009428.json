It\u2019s aimed at pressing operators there to deliver increased pay and better working conditions, including more time off.\n\nMacau casino staffers plan to march on Jan. 2 to demand higher pay and more leave time. (Image: Voice of America)\n\nLast month, the New Macau Gaming Staff Rights Association pushed the Special Administrative Region\u2019s (SAR) six license holders to boost casino workers\u2019 compensation by at least five percent. But this week\u2019s rally extends beyond the call for higher wages, expanding into the matter of what the labor group believes are onerous scheduling policies.\n\nMany gaming workers are shift workers, and the existing holiday plan provided to them is too short,\u201d said New Macau Gaming Staff Rights Association leader Cloee Chao in an interview with GGR Asia.\n\nThe group is demanding a mandatory 22-day time off policy, which is well in excess of Macau\u2019s current requirement. Labor law on the SAR mandates that workers are afforded at least one day off per week, 10 holidays per year and six vacation days after a year of working for a single employer.\n\nInteresting Timing\n\nThe march will take place less than two weeks after Ho lat Seng was sworn in as Macau\u2019s newest chief executive.\n\nHo\u2019s appointment, revealed earlier this year, drew some criticism from geopolitical experts, with some calling him a \u201cpuppet\u201d of the regime in Beijing. Critics added that the new Macau leader has two core constituencies: China\u2019s Communist Party and the six gaming companies operating on the peninsula.\n\nHe said he will give gaming employees even better benefits than what were asked for,\u201d said Chao earlier this year. \u201cI really hope he can achieve it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s some incentive for the SAR\u2019s concessionaires to work with staffers on the pay and time off issues. Amid a slump in VIP turnover, 2019 was rough in terms of gross gaming revenue (GGR) on the peninsula. With many analysts forecasting a rebound in the second half of 2020, companies may not want to disrupt those prospects with potential labor strife.\n\nSome Success\n\nThe New Macau Gaming Staff Rights Association is calling for a five percent wage hike, as well as bonuses equal to two months of workers\u2019 salaries. Whether those demands are met remains to be seen, but the group has previously notched victories in prodding bonuses out of operators.\n\nFor example, Sands China, the Macau operating unit of Las Vegas Sands, in July revealed a bonus scheme equivalent to a month of salary capped at around $6,200. That plan applied to employees that had one year of continuous service as of Aug. 30.\n\nSands rivals SJM Holdings and Wynn Resorts also delivered summer bonuses, and that was after Galaxy Entertainment, Sands, and Wynn earlier this year increased paid maternity and paternity leaves for workers.\n\nOperators there often reveal winter bonuses in January, so those announcements for 2019 could be coming over the next several weeks.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Todd Shriber"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 16:40:53 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Macau casino shift workers will march on Jan. 2 and plan to demand higher pay and a sizable increase to days off.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-corg-favicon-512-1-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "noindex, follow", "description": "Macau casino shift workers will march on Jan. 2 and plan to demand higher pay and a sizable increase to days off.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Macau Casino Staffers Will March on Thursday Demanding Higher Wages", "description": "Macau casino shift workers will march on Jan. 2 and plan to demand higher pay and a sizable increase to days off.", "url": "https://www.casino.org/news/macau-casino-staffers-will-march-on-thursday-demanding-higher-wages/", "site_name": "Casino.org", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/macau5.jpg", "width": 3000, "height": 2095, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Casino.OrgNews", "published_time": "2019-12-31T16:40:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T18:04:50+00:00"}, "author": "Todd Shriber", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@etfgodfather", "site": "@Casino_Org", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Todd Shriber", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cropped-corg-favicon-512-1-270x270.png", "title": "Macau Casino Workers Pushing For Better Pay, More Vacation Time Schedule Thursday Demonstration", "publishedDate": "December 31, 2019", "modifiedDate": "December 31, 2019", "categories": "Asia Pacific Gaming || Gaming Business", "commentCount": 0}, "canonical_link": "https://www.casino.org/news/macau-casino-staffers-will-march-on-thursday-demanding-higher-wages/"}
