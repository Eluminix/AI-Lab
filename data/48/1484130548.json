"movies": [], "text": "How Race, Age and Gender Shape Attitudes Towards Mental Health\n\nMental health has been in the news quite a bit lately. Dozens of U.S. states are currently suing Meta for contributing to the youth mental health crisis by inserting addictive features into their products, while the U.S. Surgeon General is touring the nation to bring awareness to the growing epidemic of loneliness and isolation. The country has endured periods of low national morale, such as in the 1970s when high inflation and the energy crisis worsened public sentiment following the Vietnam War. The current mood, however, feels different. Gallup recently reported that national mental health is at an all-time low, with few bright spots to lift spirits. To better understand how Americans are feeling and their attitudes towards mental health in general, ThinkNow conducted a nationally representative quantitative survey of 1,500 respondents and found some interesting differences among ethnic, age and gender groups. Technology For example, 52% agree that technology and social media have a negative impact on mental health, but when broken out by race, 61% of Whites felt technology had a negative effect, and only 48% of Hispanics thought it did. While technology has helped us keep in touch with friends and family in faraway places, it appears to have degraded our ability to connect in person. Staying connected online is a double-edged sword since the same news feed that brings us pictures of the grandkids and fluffy kittens also feeds us news about the wars in Israel and Ukraine, the dysfunction in Washington, the latest mass shooting and the climate crisis. Hispanics may have a built-in defense against the isolation technology breeds, owing to their large, multigenerational households, strong social support systems, and tendency to use social media to stay connected with relatives abroad. Age and Gender When asked how individuals rate their mental health, men rate it higher than women by 11 percentage points, and Baby Boomers rank it highest at 83%, saying it\u2019s good or excellent vs. 57% of Gen Z saying the same. Gen Z spends the most amount of time on social media, so the notion that social media negatively affects mental health appears to be correlated. Unfortunately, Gen Z is also the generation that\u2019s least comfortable discussing mental health concerns with healthcare professionals. Only 40% of them state they\u2019re comfortable discussing their issues with a professional compared to 60% of Millennials and 65% of Boomers. Race Affects Attitudes As seen in previous research conducted by ThinkNow, Asian Americans lag other groups when it comes to awareness of mental health issues. Twenty-four percent of Asian Americans believe that having a mental health issue is a sign of weakness compared to the 16% average for all groups. Asians are also considerably less likely to be aware of mental health services in their communities (42% vs. 55%) and most likely to seek out information on social media (51% vs. 35%).", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Search Engine Journal", "Chiara Aliotta", "Oecd Directorate For Financial", "Enterprise Affairs", "Marius Sescu", "Expeed Software", "Teekay Tankers Ltd", "Teekay Corporation", "Gruppo Tim", "Or Royalties Inc."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android - Download as a PDF or view online for free", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://public.slidesharecdn.com/_next/static/media/favicon.7bc3d920.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "noindex, nofollow", "title": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android", "description": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android - Download as a PDF or view online for free", "twitter": {"site": "@SlideShare", "card": "player", "title": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android", "description": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android - Download as a PDF or view online for free", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/50popularbeliefsthatpeoplethinkaretrueaudiobookfreedownload50popularbeliefsthatpeoplethinkaretrueaud-200101193340-thumbnail.jpg?width=640&height=640&fit=bounds", "alt": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android"}, "player": {"identifier": "https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ogQBarxdHzDSi7", "width": 597, "height": 486}, "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "SlideShare Android", "iphone": "SlideShare iOS", "ipad": "SlideShare iOS"}, "id": {"googleplay": "net.slideshare.mobile", "iphone": 917418728, "ipad": 917418728}, "url": {"iphone": "slideshare-app://ss/165952101", "ipad": "slideshare-app://ss/165952101"}}}, "og": {"site_name": "SlideShare", "type": "website", "url": "https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true-audiobook-free-download-50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true-audiobook-mp3-for-android-213833747/213833747", "title": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android", "description": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android - Download as a PDF or view online for free", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.slidesharecdn.com/ss_thumbnails/50popularbeliefsthatpeoplethinkaretrueaudiobookfreedownload50popularbeliefsthatpeoplethinkaretrueaud-200101193340-thumbnail.jpg?width=640&height=640&fit=bounds", "alt": "50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook free download | 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True Audiobook mp3 for android", "type": "image/webp", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "next-head-count": 41}, "canonical_link": "https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true-audiobook-free-download-50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true-audiobook-mp3-for-android-213833747/213833747"}
