Lenny Henry simply tweeted \u201cwow\u201d at the news, while theatre director Matthew Xia asked: \u201cHow have the producers managed to get away with this for almost 60 years?\u201d\n\nThough Corrie introduced its first black character \u2013 Shirley Armitage, played by Lisa Lewis \u2013 in 1983, the arrival of the Baileys was a major step forward for the 59-year-old soap, coming almost 30 years after the Taverniers arrived in EastEnders\u2019 Albert Square in 1990. The Bailey family would include the usual mix of high drama and plausibility \u2013 patriarch Edison with his gambling addiction, eldest son and wheeler-dealer Michael, youngest son James, a gay footballer, and kindly matriarch Aggie.\n\n\u201cCoronation Street is a national treasure,\u201d says Trevor Michael Georges, who plays Edison, \u201cso when they announced they were looking for their first black family, that marked a real shift in mentality.\u201d Georges has a history in opera and theatre, so Corrie marked a major shift for him, too. \u201cThe problem is not being the first of something but paving the way for the second or third,\u201d he says. \u201cThat way you build a legacy and when you get to the third iteration, the novelty has worn off so you\u2019re appreciated on your own merits.\u201d\n\nStill, with no precedent to fall back on, it has been tricky. \u201cThere is an immense pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no one I can go to for advice. It has been nerve-racking, but we just have to set up the pathway for others to follow.\u201d\n\nWith a storyline concerning racism and homophobia in football, Nathan Graham\u2019s character, James, feels especially current. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to shine a light on issues happening in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to show all facets of James\u2019s character and not stereotype him. Representation is increasing \u2013 but we still need to stay authentic.\u201d\n\nCorrie might be the nation\u2019s favourite soap, but, with viewing figures dropping across the board, there\u2019s hope this injection of diversity will prove an incentive for new viewers to tune in.\n\n\u201cThis family has been so welcomed,\u201d says Lorna Laidlaw, who plays Aggie. So many of her friends and family have come back to Corrie because of the Baileys \u2013 and she has been contacted by younger BAME actors asking for advice on breaking into the industry. \u201cActing is really tough and there isn\u2019t enough representation, so this is a role of a lifetime,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t have more open casting now. Why we can\u2019t have a black lawyer or black businessman on TV, too?\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ammar Kalia"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "This year, Coronation Street shocked fans by introducing the Baileys \u2013 its first family of colour after almost 60 years on air.
