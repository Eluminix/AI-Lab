Lorenzo provides the best bets you can make on each. USA TODAY\n\nA preview of the NFC wild-card matchup between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints\n\nWhen: Sunday, Jan. 5, 1:05 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: The Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans\n\nChannel: FOX\n\nLine: Saints by 7\u00bd\n\nInjuries: Three of the Saints' four starting defensive backs missed the regular-season finale due to injury, including cornerback Eli Apple (ankle) and safeties Vonn Bell (knee) and Marcus Williams (groin). It's unclear whether any or all of them will be available Sunday. Fullback Zach Line's status is also unclear as he deals with a knee injury.\n\nFor Minnesota, the good news is that star running back Dalvin Cook told reporters this week that he plans to return Sunday after missing the past two weeks with a shoulder injury. \"I got some rest, and I\u2019m ready to go,\" he said. The player worth monitoring is starting linebacker Eric Kendricks, who missed last week's game with a quadriceps injury and will likely be questionable this week.\n\nTHREE THINGS TO KNOW\n\n1. A miraculous rematch: These two teams will long be remembered for the iconic sequence that ended their playoff matchup two years ago, when Case Keenum threw a game-winning touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs in the closing seconds of their divisional-round matchup in a moment that has been dubbed \"The Minneapolis Miracle.\" The key difference this time around, of course, is that New Orleans will be playing at home. The Saints have won seven of their past eight playoff games at the Superdome dating back to 2000, and you can bet Sunday's crowd will be raucous.\n\n2. Top turnover teams: The Saints and Vikings ranked second and fifth, respectively, in turnover differential during the regular season, and New Orleans took care of the ball at a historic level. The Saints set a new NFL record by committing just eight turnovers in 2019, eclipsing the previous record of 10 that was shared by the 2010 Patriots and 2011 49ers. So don't expect many turnovers in Sunday's game \u2014 but any that arise could prove to be especially impactful.\n\n3. QBs trending in opposite directions: Saints quarterback Drew Brees has been on a tear in recent weeks, throwing 16 touchdowns and no interceptions over the past five games \u2014 including a 29-for-30 performance against the Colts on Dec. 16. Minnesota's Kirk Cousins, meanwhile, has thrown picks in three of his past four games and only surpassed 250 passing yards once in that span. If he's able to reverse those trends, the Vikings will have a shot in this one. If not, Brees and company will in all likelihood march on to the divisional round.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tom Schad"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The last time the Vikings and Saints met in the playoffs, the two NFC contenders produced one of the most memorable finishes in NFL history.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2020/01/01/minnesota-vikings-new-orleans-saints-preview-playoffs-nfc/2775564001/sports/nfl/playoffs", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Minnesota Vikings vs. New Orleans Saints wild-card playoff preview: Another miracle on tap?", "description": "The last time the Vikings and Saints met in the playoffs, the two NFC contenders produced one of the most memorable finishes in NFL history.", "site_name": "USA TODAY"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "The last time the Vikings and Saints met in the playoffs, the two NFC contenders produced one of the most memorable finishes in NFL history.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2020/01/01/minnesota-vikings-new-orleans-saints-preview-playoffs-nfc/2775564001/"}
