The bodies arrived at Noi Bai airport in Hanoi early on Wednesday, online newspaper VnExpress reported, and would be taken by ambulances to homes in Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces. The remaining bodies would be repatriated later, VnExpress said.\n\n\u201cAfter waiting for so many days, my son has finally arrived,\u201d Nguyen Dinh Gia, father of victim Nguyen Dinh Luong, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened, but we have to hold back the emotion to organise the funeral for my son,\u201d Gia said by phone from his home in Can Loc, Ha Tinh province.\n\nVietnamese police have said the deceased came from six provinces: Haiphong, Hai Duong, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Hue. Their families were plagued by confusion and anguish over how to get the bodies home.\n\nThe families would have to pay for the repatriation costing up to \u00a32,208, according to a foreign ministry statement seen by Reuters. The statement, dated 14 November, said the Vietnamese government would advance the payment which families could repay later.\n\nThough relatives were encouraged by authorities to opt for ashes \u201cto ensure speed, low cost and sanitation safety\u201d, many paid more for the bodies to carry out traditional burials. Cremation is rare in the Vietnam countryside, where many of the victims were from.\n\nOn Monday the Northern Irish driver of the truck, 25-year-old Maurice Robinson, pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist illegal immigration. He also admitted to acquiring cash that came from criminal conduct, but did not plead guilty to 41 other charges. Several other people have been arrested in the UK while Vietnam has held at least 10 people, though none have been formally charged.\n\nWith Reuters and AFP", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Wed Nov 27 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Sixteen of the 39 deceased flown to Hanoi, with the rest to be repatriated later, say officials and media", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Sixteen of the 39 deceased flown to Hanoi, with the rest to be repatriated later, say officials and media", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60721ce04a3ae941c7f254b91fca1a9bd23d7b7d/0_0_5823_3494/master/5823.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=39810ecbb58cb8a09bbfa4f540f36796", "height": 720}, "title": "'My son has finally arrived': first of Essex lorry bodies returned to Vietnam", "description": "Sixteen of the 39 deceased flown to Hanoi, with the rest to be repatriated later, say officials and media", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Staff and agencies", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2019-11-27T18:50:05.000Z", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2019-11-27T06:10:30.000Z", "tag": "UK news,Vietnam"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60721ce04a3ae941c7f254b91fca1a9bd23d7b7d/0_0_5823_3494/master/5823.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=5a05b48ef7fdcde6500c91df8c65fbe2", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/27/first-of-essex-lorry-bodies-returned-to-vietnam"}
