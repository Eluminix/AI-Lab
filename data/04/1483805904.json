This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!\u2019\n\nAmerican airstrikes on Sunday killed 25 fighters of an Iran-backed militia in Iraq, the Kataeb Hezbollah.\n\nMap showing the size of the compound\n\nThe Green Zone in Iraq where the US Embassy is based\n\nTear gas was fired at protesters who made it into the US compound (Picture: AP)\n\nThe US said those strikes were in retaliation for last week\u2019s killing of an American contractor and the wounding of American and Iraqi troops in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that the US blamed on the militia.\n\nThe American strikes angered the Iraqi government, which called them an unjustified violation of its sovereignty.\n\n\u2018Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many,\u2019 Mr Trump tweeted from his estate in Florida.\n\n\u2018We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!\u2019\n\nA fire was started at the US embassy in Baghdad after the compound came under attack (Picture: AP)\n\nMr Trump said that Iran was \u2018fully responsible\u2019 for the attack (Picture: AP)\n\nMr Esper did not specify the soldiers\u2019 destination, but a source said they will go to Kuwait (Picture: Getty)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["World"], "tags": ["Crime", "Lifeline", "Better Living", "Black Friday", "Astrology", "Science", "Hacks", "What I Own", "Donald Trump", "Cost of Living", "Travel Advice", "What I Rent", "London", "Interiors", "Deals", "Renting", "Home renovations", "Travel Reviews", "Chinese Zodiac", "Beauty Products", "Tarot", "Saving", "Snooker", "Soaps Showbiz", "Transfer News", "Travel Inspiration", "Property Prices", "Premier League", "Columnists", "Amazon Prime Day"], "authors": ["Richard Hartley-Parkinson"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The US president has said that Iran was 'fully responsible' for the attack.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/m-icon-black-32.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/m-icon-black-270.png", "msvalidate.01": "AE7395BB35A71648216DC12EB230C308", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.2", "ob": {"article": {"section": {"name": "World", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/news/world/"}}}, "sailthru.date": "2020-01-01 08:02:50", "sailthru.title": "Trump prepares for battle as he deploys 4,000 troops after embassy attack", "sailthru.description": "The US president has said that Iran was 'fully responsible' for the attack.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flare3-e851.gif?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flare3-e851.gif?w=50&h=150&crop=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "description": "The US president has said that Iran was 'fully responsible' for the attack.", "keywords": "World", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Trump prepares for battle as he deploys 4,000 troops after embassy attack", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/01/trump-prepares-for-battle-as-he-deploys-4000-troops-after-embassy-attack-11984815/", "description": "The US president has said that Iran was 'fully responsible' for the attack.", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PRC_115589128_1577872249.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PRC_115589128_1577872249.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "News", "published_time": "2020-01-01T08:02:50+0000", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T09:50:46+0000", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/richardhartleyparkinson"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PRC_115589128.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Trump prepares for battle as he deploys 4,000 troops after embassy attack", "description": "The US president has said that Iran was 'fully responsible' for the attack.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 176908729004638}, "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "pocket-site-verification": "8aec208948f7b2f9092ac4ce91dac7"}, "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/01/trump-prepares-for-battle-as-he-deploys-4000-troops-after-embassy-attack-11984815/"}
