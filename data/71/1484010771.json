We tried using butter to help lubricate the area but he still couldn\u2019t move.\n\n\u201cIt was also snowing so was very cold for him \u2013 which is also very dangerous for a snake \u2013 so I was scared he would die if we could not release him quickly as he had been there for a few hours.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen A fire crew cutting the snake free after he became trapped in the gearstick casing of his owners\u2019 car. Photograph: RSPCA/PA\n\nThe fact Allan had eaten a large meal that day also worked against him, trapping him in the car.\n\nAfter an RSPCA inspector arrived at the scene, Greater Manchester fire and rescue service had to be called to cut the snake free.\n\nWhile the inspector, Angela Paxton-Taylor, held Allan with a damp towel to ensure the temperature of the metal around the reptile did not get too hot, the firefighters cut through a small piece of metal which was enough to allow it to be lifted free.\n\n0:55 Snakes on the streets of Britain, but why? \u2013 video\n\nPaxton-Taylor said: \u201cAlong with the fire crews we were able to safely release him and he appeared unharmed \u2013 a few scales were missing and he was very cold but we were able to warm him up and he is doing well.\n\n\u201cIt was awkward as there was me and five firefighters in a Citroen C1 working hard to free Allan but it worked. The fire service who worked brilliantly as a team and were determined and really considerate for the wellbeing of Alan.\u201d\n\nBond said Allan has fully recovered from the ordeal and is now \u201cback to his lazy self\u201d.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Allan, a 1.5 metre corn snake, had been driving to Oldham with its owners for Christmas", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Allan, a 1.5 metre corn snake, had been driving to Oldham with its owners for Christmas", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960dae6ada99d0bc133203b6454332153bfe24be/0_1128_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cc73cdd0c3d90fe5c06ead53cd8d1bec", "height": 720}, "title": "Pet snake cut free after getting trapped under car\u2019s gearstick", "description": "Allan, a 1.5 metre corn snake, had been driving to Oldham with its owners for Christmas", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "PA Media", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T11:39:26.000Z", "section": "Environment", "published_time": "2019-12-31T17:51:18.000Z", "tag": "Snakes,Pets,Wildlife,UK news,Animals"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick", "iphone": "gnmguardian://environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960dae6ada99d0bc133203b6454332153bfe24be/0_1128_2625_1575/master/2625.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=17629b835e4642c0dcb5134aea659ddf", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/31/pet-snake-cut-free-after-getting-trapped-under-cars-gearstick"}
