Companies that view hiring as merely finding workers worry about thank you emails. \u2014 The Hoarse Whisperer (@TheRealHoarse) April 6, 2019\n\nThis is an arbitrary bit of gatekeeping that is both culture- and generation-specific. In doing this you\u2019re also gong to skew results to people who act and think like you, thereby decreasing intellectual diversity on the team. A thank you is classy, but not a disqualifier. \u2014 Scott Hanselman \ud83c\udf2e (@shanselman) April 6, 2019\n\nYou know taking a day off work, going someplace unfamiliar, then participating in ~8 hours of technical and personal interviews is exhausting, right? \u2014 Rebecca (Slatkin) Sloane (@RebeccaSlatkin) April 7, 2019\n\nThese employees will be creating value for your company, it\u2019s you that should be thankful. No wonder people leave after few months, sounds like a toxic work environment where only the yay sayers are accepted \u2014 Marijam Did\u017egalvyt\u0117 (@marijamdid) April 5, 2019\n\nMany users also wondered whether Liebman sent thankyou emails to interviewees for taking the time to meet with her:\n\nHave you been sending everyone who applies thank you notes too? Signalling goes both ways. \u2014 Nat (@unfortunatalie) April 7, 2019\n\nBut others agreed with her approach, saying sending thankyou emails is a professional and courteous thing to do.\n\nIt's professional courtesy to send a thank you email. Plenty of people with talent out there who still have manners. \u2014 Melissa Hope (@missyhopez) April 6, 2019\n\nI agree with her on this. The level of effort that goes into screening and hiring a canidate is STRESSFUL, and to not even send a thank-you note or letter shows to me 1. You're inconsiderate, and 2. Your business etiquette is lacking. But most of all you're inconsiderate. \u2014 Justin E Samuels (@ThugDebugger) April 7, 2019\n\nIn 2012, Liebman wrote a similar article detailing her expectations for thankyou emails.\n\nShe said the interviewee should thank her for taking the time to talk with them, restate they wanted the job and add a quick plug about why they would be perfect for it.\n\nShe said if she didn't get an email like this, she would \"assume you don't want the job\" and \"think you're disorganised and forgot about following up\", adding \"there is a much higher shot I'll forget about you\".\n\nNews.com.au has contacted Liebman for comment.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["best", "of", "2019", "boss", "sparks", "social", "media", "uproar", "after", "sharing", "her", "rule", "for", "hiring", "people", "every", "year", "trawl", "through", "archives", "republish", "standout", "business", "stories", "from", "last", "this", "essentially", "most", "popular", "topical", "insightful", "pieces", "published", "heres", "that", "made", "cut", "piece", "first", "april"], "tags": ["Lower Hutt", "Kaikohe", "The Front Page", "Stratford", "Shop home & living", "Rail holidays", "All Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Motueka", "Napier", "Auckland", "International travel", "TV", "Palmerston North", "Shop fashion", "Property Insider", "All Wellington", "Coromandel & Hauraki", "Hastings", "Tasman", "Far North", "Shop entertainment", "Adventure travel", "Europe", "Health", "Middle East", "Health & wellbeing", "Asia", "Editorials", "Otago / Queenstown", "Wairarapa", "Australia", "USA", "Pacific", "Whakat\u0101ne", "Wanaka", "On the Tiles", "New Plymouth", "The Great NZ Road Trip", "Kapiti", "Te Awamutu", "Upper Hutt", "Ashburton", "Recipe collections", "Rural technology", "Analysis", "On The Up", "Opinion", "P\u0101p\u0101moa", "Pacific Islands", "Morning quiz", "Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Kea Kids news", "Dargaville", "Bay of Islands", "Central Hawke's Bay", "Whangarei", "Cambridge", "Otago", "Ask me Anything", "Open Justice", "Kaipara", "Taranaki", "Christchurch", "H\u0101wera", "Wellington", "Nelson-Tasman", "Letters to the editor", "Society Insider", "Dunedin", "Movies", "All Otago", "Restaurant reviews", "Luxury travel", "West Coast", "United States", "All Taranaki", "Invercargill", "Scam Update", "Te Puke", "Tauranga", "Queenstown", "Katikati", "Stewart Island", "Fashion & beauty", "Havelock North", "All Southland", "Shop beauty", "Pets & animals", "All Opinion", "Music reviews", "Milford's Investing Place", "Deloitte Top 200 Awards", "Movie reviews", "UK", "Book reviews", "Reviews", "New Zealand", "Premium opinion", "All Canterbury", "Matamata & Piako", "Taup\u014d & T\u016brangi", "Mount Maunganui", "Canterbury", "Culture", "Tokoroa & South Waikato", "Music", "Nelson", "Manawat\u016b", "Business analysis", "Ski holidays", "All Quizzes", "Sex & relationships", "Oamaru", "Gore", "Southland", "Social media", "Best NZ beaches", "Shop gifts", "Timaru", "Cartoons", "Afternoon quiz", "Sports quiz", "Animal health", "Kerikeri", "Rowing", "NZ Open", "Food & drink", "Africa", "AI", "Mangawhai", "Balclutha", "Books", "Cruise holidays", "Marlborough", "Kaik\u014dura", "Northland", "Quizzes", "Wairoa", "Cooking the Books", "Alexandra", "Hamilton", "Horowhenua", "The Little Things"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Every year, we trawl through the archives and republish a few of the standout business stories from the last year.
