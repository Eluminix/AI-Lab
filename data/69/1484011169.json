Trump leads Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, 51%-42%; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, 49%-44%; and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 49%-45%.\n\nBiden's lead over Trump is slightly wider in Virginia, where the former vice president leads the incumbent 49%-45%. The other Democrats trail the president in the state. The poll says Trump beats Warren 48%-44%, Sanders 51%-45% and Buttigieg 47%-45%.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll released this month said Trump beat every Democratic candidate, including Biden, in a national matchup.\n\nFlorida is an important swing state, narrowly deciding the 2000 election after a lengthy and controversial recount. It went for Trump in 2016 after backing President Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008.\n\nThe swing voters: Meet the voters who could decide if Trump's reelected\n\nGallup poll: Donald Trump, Barack Obama tie for most admired man\n\nVirginia has elected Democrats in recent statewide elections after years of being a red state,\n\n\"Over the last 30 years, Virginia has evolved from a state that leaned Republican in presidential elections, then, first, into a true swing state, but now has become one that clearly leans Democratic. Still, Democrats cannot completely take Virginia for granted as former Vice President Joe Biden is their only current candidate who is beating President Donald Trump,\" the Mason Dixon firm says in the introduction to its poll.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLarry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, is not surprised by the results. Sabato tweeted that although Virginia may lean blue, it won't vote for just any Democrat.\n\n\"Identity of D nominee matters. People surprised by Mason-Dixon's results see VA as being deep Blue. It isn't,\" he wrote.\n\nThe election is next November. Some fundamentals can change. Overall, VA leans D, but it won't vote for just any D. Identity of D nominee matters. People surprised by Mason-Dixon's results see VA as being deep Blue. It isn't. https://t.co/arKcJhRNIg \u2014 Larry Sabato (@LarrySabato) December 31, 2019\n\nVirginia voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Obama in 2012 and 2008. Before that, it went for every Republican nominee dating back to Richard Nixon in 1968.\n\nThe Virginia poll was conducted via telephone from Dec. 12-16, and the Florida poll was conducted from Dec. 11-16. Both have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nUSA TODAY Poll: Impeached or not, Trump leads his Democratic rivals for another term\n\nMore: Narrow majority opposes removing Trump from office if he is impeached\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Election 2020: Poll says Trump beats every Dem but Biden in Florida, Virginia", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Donald Trump", "Vice President Joe Biden", "Florida", "Virginia", "Democratic candidate", "Mayor Pete Buttigieg", "Larry Sabato", "President Barack Obama", "University of Virginia"], "tags": ["Crypto", "Housing", "ETF report", "Super Bowl", "Economics", "Earnings", "Options pit", "FA corner", "Stock market"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Virginia and Florida will be important states in deciding the winner of the 2020 election.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Virginia and Florida will be important states in deciding the winner of the 2020 election.", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Vice President Joe Biden, Florida, Virginia, Democratic candidate, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Larry Sabato, President Barack Obama, University of Virginia", "robots": "noindex, nofollow, max-image-preview:large", "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "conf": {"cjs": {"consent-flow": "yguce", "locale": "en-US"}}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@YahooNews", "creator": "@YahooNews", "title": "Trump would beat every Democrat but Biden in Florida and Virginia, polls say", "description": "Virginia and Florida will be important states in deciding the winner of the 2020 election.", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AiN92gbDeAOhXMkOzvs7EA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/17c91a9bf38c7f8f2a5e6e6a873d46a1"}, "og": {"title": "Trump would beat every Democrat but Biden in Florida and Virginia, polls say", "description": "Virginia and Florida will be important states in deciding the winner of the 2020 election.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-beat-every-democrat-biden-173045348.html", "site_name": "Yahoo News", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/AiN92gbDeAOhXMkOzvs7EA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/17c91a9bf38c7f8f2a5e6e6a873d46a1", "height": 651, "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=8d18a2a9-2c24-308d-aa00-19edb00f8b71&src=web"}, "android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=8d18a2a9-2c24-308d-aa00-19edb00f8b71&src=web"}}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-beat-every-democrat-biden-173045348.html"}
