Credit: Facebook\n\nFriends said Helen, who had just left her husband, was \u201cjust starting to get her life back together\u201d but had to call 999 over Christmas after being threatened.\n\nThe trouble flared again at the New Year as she marked the occasion with her new partner.\n\nShocked neighbours heard someone yell: \u201cThey\u2019re dead! They\u2019re dead! What have you f******g done?\u201d at about 3am.\n\nPolice arrived just over an hour later to find two \u201cfatally injured\u201d people in the three-bedroom home.\n\nA spokesman said they arrested a 39-year-old man at the scene on suspicion of double murder and will question him today.

They\u2019re dead! What have you f***ing done?\u2019 over and over.\u201d\n\nAnother former neighbour, who did not want to be identified, said: \u201cIt\u2019s tragic. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m shocked.\n\n\u201cThe marriage was on and off. I lived close enough to know what went on and so did some of the other neighbours.\n\n'THEY'RE DEAD! WHAT HAVE YOU F***ING DONE?'\n\n\u201cRhys came across as this caring teacher who dedicated his life to kids with special needs.\n\n\u201cHelen tried many times to make a life without him. Then last year, she plucked up the courage to kick him out for good.\n\n\u201cAbout six months ago she started seeing this guy. She was really getting her life together.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know too much about him but I think they met through some sports club \u2014 she loved netball and keep fit.\n\n\"I heard he was a keen runner.\u201d\n\nScenes of crime officers searched the \u00a3415,000 home yesterday and a grey Seat thought to belong to Mr Hancock was taken away.\n\nAnother grey Seat, thought to be Ms Almey\u2019s, and a Honda Civic, believed to be her boyfriend\u2019s, remained on the drive.\n\nAnother resident, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cI woke up this morning and looked outside to see what was going on.\n\n9 The 39-year-old was killed in her Duffield home near Derby\n\n9 Helen had three children under the age of 10 Credit: Facebook\n\n\u201cAll I could see was tape and cones everywhere and police cars. It\u2019s a bit surreal.\u201d\n\nA former school pal of Helen\u2019s added: \u201cDuffield is a small place where everyone knows everyone so we\u2019re all in complete and utter shock. We can\u2019t stop thinking about Helen\u2019s poor children.\n\n\u201cShe was a lovely girl. She was very popular at school.\u201d\n\nNeighbours in the village - which counts Derby FC footballer Tom Lawrence among its residents - yesterday described their shock.\n\nA former school pal said: \u201cHelen was a lovely girl.
