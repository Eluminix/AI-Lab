Now I date her. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I have to say. Happy New Year to each and every one of you,\" she wrote.\n\nShe hasn't \"paraded\" her relationship in public, she wrote, but her friends and family have known about it for more than a year. \"NOT THAT IT\u2019S ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS BUT...,\" she opened her post.\n\nShe wrote she had a difficult year, including coping with grief (her father, conservative activist and writer Herbert London, died in November 2018) and unforeseen health problems.\n\n\"But as with most of life, there has been such incredible joy as well and the person most responsible for that is @catyezbak, who is my girlfriend and has been for over a year. Some of you may have guessed that already. All my friends and family know her well,\" she wrote.\n\nLondon told her followers she resisted blabbing on social media about Yezbak not out of shame but because she disliked her past experiences with \"public relationships.\"\n\n\"But I want to be clear here that with Cat I felt I owed us the chance to be private since this is my first serious relationship with a woman and I\u2019m sure there will be some hoo ha about that,\" she wrote. \"But I would never hide her out of shame.\"\n\nShe also acknowledged she has it relatively easy, as \"a privileged white woman who is 50,\" to confirm a same-sex relationship with \"very few repercussions.\"\n\n\"Unlike me, there are countless people in the LGBTQIAP community who have had no choice in who they are, no love from family on which to lean, no support from anyone anywhere,\" she wrote. \"I fell in love, truly in love, with this beautiful, sexy, kind soul and I won\u2019t apologize for that but I stand on the shoulders of a community that fought like hell for me to be able to do openly and proudly and EASILY.\"\n\nShe cheerfully concluded: \"Bring it 2020. Let\u2019s go.\"\n\nHaters need not post, she added. \"AND ALSO: any awful comments will be deleted immediately. My account will not tolerate hate of any kind.)", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Maria Puente"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Stacy London is happy in love with a woman she just introduced on Instagram. \\", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/01/stacy-london-in-love-woman-introduces-girlfriend-instagram/2789411001/entertainment/celebrities", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Fashion maven Stacy London is 'in love' with a woman, introduces her girlfriend on Instagram", "description": "Stacy London is happy in love with a woman she just introduced on Instagram. \\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/01/01/USAT/c9f9a251-381f-4974-982d-5f52c6ab2f62-GTY_1180828175.JPG?auto=webp&crop=5999,3374,x0,y324&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Stacy London is happy in love with a woman she just introduced on Instagram. \\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/01/stacy-london-in-love-woman-introduces-girlfriend-instagram/2789411001/"}
