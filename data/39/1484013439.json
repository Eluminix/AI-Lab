Frank Lampard spent the majority of a scrappy contest bemoaning his team\u2019s sloppiness in the final third and they paid a heavy price, suffering another stumble in the race to qualify for the Champions League when Alireza Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to rescue a deserved draw for Brighton with an astonishing bicycle kick.\n\nInconsistent and imprecise, Chelsea have not won successive Premier League games since the start of November and they could not complain after failing to withstand a spirited comeback from Brighton. Lampard, who was outmanoeuvred by Graham Potter\u2019s tactical alterations, had much to ponder.\n\nIt was a disappointing effort from Chelsea and the lack of incision should convince the club to take advantage of their transfer ban being lifted as speculation mounts about moves for Jadon Sancho, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Wilfried Zaha and Timo Werner.\n\n\u201cIt was an incredible equaliser but I think we deserved it,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cIn the first half, if we are ruthless, the game is out of sight. We had opportunities to play people in who could score, to keep doing what we did in the first 20 minutes. We came off that slightly. We allowed them to feel they\u2019re in the game and they\u2019re a good team.\n\n\u201cThe Christmas period has probably been a small showing of our season. Tottenham was a fantastic performance. Arsenal showed great spirit for a young group. Southampton, we struggled to break a team down and lost at home. Then today we should have the mindset to kill it and we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLampard was fuming and he stonewalled suggestions Chelsea could include Olivier Giroud as part of an \u00a380m deal to sign Zaha from Crystal Palace. \u201cThe idea of that deal is something I have never considered,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about Zaha because he is not a player of ours. If we have to do business we will do it in the way we see fit, to try to make us better, and that\u2019s behind closed doors.\u201d\n\nNonetheless Chelsea\u2019s forwards should be worried. Christian Pulisic flattered to deceive before being replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi, who was just as ineffective on the left, and Willian offered little on the right. There was a lack of care in the decisive areas and Lampard grew irritable as the first half wore on, grumbling when Tammy Abraham spurned a chance to add to C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta\u2019s 10th-minute goal, shooting when he could have released Willian.\n\nNot that it was all about the big team\u2019s failings. This was Brighton\u2019s first ever point against Chelsea and they might even have snatched all three after Jahanbakhsh\u2019s stunner, only for Kepa Arrizabalaga to repel Neal Maupay\u2019s low drive. Arrizabalaga would also make a fine stop from Aaron Connolly, whose introduction at the break gave Brighton more urgency. \u201cI thought the players were amazing,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou go toe to toe with Chelsea and if you make mistakes they punish you. We had to adjust because our structure wasn\u2019t so good in the first half. We got better.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta taps in from close range to give Chelsea an early lead at Brighton.

Willian crossed to the far post, where Kurt Zouma headed down for Abraham to shoot from close range. Aaron Mooy blocked on the line but the ball broke to Azpilicueta, who turned in his third goal of the season.\n\nAt that stage, with Brighton uncomfortable in a midfield diamond, Chelsea should have pulled clear. But perhaps it was too easy. Chelsea\u2019sintensity faded and Brighton threatened before half-time, Maupay teeing up Leandro Trossard to test Arrizabalaga.\n\nBrighton, who will be without Dan Burn for two months after the left-backbroke his collarbone in a collision with James, were improving.\n\nPotter jettisoned the diamond and he made another alteration during the interval, removing Yves Bissouma for Connolly.\n\nThe change meant Brighton were using a 4-4-2 and Potter was rewarded for throwing caution to the wind. Arrizabalaga denied Connolly but the breakthrough arrived when Lewis Dunk\u2019s header led to Jahanbakhsh\u2019s moment of magic. The Iranian winger had ended his long wait for a Brighton goal during last weekend\u2019s win over Bournemouth and his second in two games means Chelsea must ask themselves some tough questions.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jacob Steinberg"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=73ae1d139925dfc4f8ed775c81cde59d", "height": 720}, "title": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh\u2019s overhead stunner for Brighton denies Chelsea", "description": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh hit a superb equaliser six minutes from time to earn Brighton a 1-1 draw after C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta had given Chelsea an early lead", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jacob-steinberg", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2022-10-19T15:23:34.000Z", "section": "Football", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:49:27.000Z", "tag": "Premier League,Brighton & Hove Albion,Chelsea,Football,Sport"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "iphone": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JacobSteinberg", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6821484be2a7367f5dc8a95b6062ca366a0a0251/127_88_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=956a0f154b7ea1dec60c0a5159066489", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/01/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report"}
