Sharks are not like a fly where if you stay still they will go away.\n\n\u2022 Don't wave your hands about as they can identify you as looking distressed.\n\n\u2022 Ignore the myth of punching a shark in the nose, you are better to go for the gill or an eye. This can give you more time to get away.\n\n\u2022 Don't grab a shark by the tail as it can swing around to bite you.\n\n\u2022 If a shark starts circling you that's a sign they are getting ready to attack - so get out of the water as quickly as possible.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["great", "white", "shark", "washes", "up", "on", "orewa", "beach", "27metre", "female", "juvenile", "washed", "after", "getting", "caught", "fishing", "net"], "tags": ["Lower Hutt", "Kaikohe", "The Front Page", "Stratford", "Shop home & living", "Rail holidays", "All Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Motueka", "Napier", "Auckland", "International travel", "TV", "Palmerston North", "Shop fashion", "Property Insider", "All Wellington", "Coromandel & Hauraki", "Hastings", "Tasman", "Far North", "Shop entertainment", "Adventure travel", "Europe", "Health", "Middle East", "Health & wellbeing", "Asia", "Editorials", "Otago / Queenstown", "Wairarapa", "Australia", "USA", "Pacific", "Whakat\u0101ne", "Wanaka", "On the Tiles", "New Plymouth", "The Great NZ Road Trip", "Kapiti", "Te Awamutu", "Upper Hutt", "Ashburton", "Recipe collections", "Rural technology", "Analysis", "On The Up", "Opinion", "P\u0101p\u0101moa", "Pacific Islands", "Morning quiz", "Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Kea Kids news", "Dargaville", "Bay of Islands", "Central Hawke's Bay", "Whangarei", "Cambridge", "Otago", "Ask me Anything", "Open Justice", "Kaipara", "Taranaki", "Christchurch", "H\u0101wera", "Wellington", "Nelson-Tasman", "Letters to the editor", "Society Insider", "Dunedin", "Movies", "All Otago", "Restaurant reviews", "Luxury travel", "West Coast", "United States", "All Taranaki", "Invercargill", "Scam Update", "Te Puke", "Tauranga", "Queenstown", "Katikati", "Stewart Island", "Fashion & beauty", "Havelock North", "All Southland", "Shop beauty", "Pets & animals", "All Opinion", "Music reviews", "Milford's Investing Place", "Deloitte Top 200 Awards", "Movie reviews", "UK", "Book reviews", "Reviews", "New Zealand", "Premium opinion", "All Canterbury", "Matamata & Piako", "Taup\u014d & T\u016brangi", "Mount Maunganui", "Canterbury", "Culture", "Tokoroa & South Waikato", "Music", "Nelson", "Manawat\u016b", "Business analysis", "Ski holidays", "All Quizzes", "Sex & relationships", "Oamaru", "Gore", "Southland", "Social media", "Best NZ beaches", "Shop gifts", "Timaru", "Cartoons", "Afternoon quiz", "Sports quiz", "Animal health", "Kerikeri", "Rowing", "NZ Open", "Food & drink", "Africa", "AI", "Mangawhai", "Balclutha", "Books", "Cruise holidays", "Marlborough", "Kaik\u014dura", "Northland", "Quizzes", "Wairoa", "Cooking the Books", "Alexandra", "Hamilton", "Horowhenua", "The Little Things"], "authors": ["Emma Russell"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 2.7-metre female juvenile great white shark has washed up on Orewa beach after getting caught in a fishing net.
