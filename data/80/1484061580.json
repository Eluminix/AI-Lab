Photo / Supplied\n\nIn other cases the boats might be sold for what looks like a bargain, until the new owner realised how much work it took to repair and maintain.\n\nAs these vessels aged them being abandoned was increasing and it was difficult to identify owners, Hayton said.\n\nWhile the moorings were registered, there was no boat registration in New Zealand.\n\n\"Some people put dead boats onto moorings to dump them, so it is quite easy to shirk responsibility.\"\n\nThere was no typical process, rather the harbourmaster's team would take note of what looked like an abandoned boat, and seek to find the owner.\n\n\"It is quite easy to tell when they've been abandoned. There might be excessive growth on it, seagulls nesting, or even trees growing on them. They can be real eyesores.\"\n\nIf the owner could not be identified, under the Maritime Act they were required to place a notice on the vessel, an advertisement in the Herald, and contact police.\n\nHarbourmaster Andrew Hayton says it is \"easy to tell\" when a boat has been abandoned. Photo / Supplied\n\nIf no owner came forward they would then seek to sell the vessel, but if it was beyond repair they would salvage what they could and dispose of the rest.\n\nThe process could cost anywhere between a few hundred dollars up to $30,000, the higher figure especially if the boat had sunk, as it would require divers.\n\nThere were about six boats going through that process now, but about 200 throughout Auckland's waters Hayton and his team are keeping an eye on.\n\nHayton said rather than simply abandoning boats owners should get in touch with the harbourmaster.\n\n\"The onus is on boat owners to keep their vessels seaworthy. But we understand people can fall on hard times, or people pass away and the boat be left with others.\n\n\"If you are unable to look after it, please just get in touch with us and we'll do what we can to help.\n\n\"Getting onto it sooner you might be able to recover some costs, whereas leaving it will end up costing more money.\"\n\nAuckland Yacht and Boating Association chair Ian Clouston said a lot of boats were abandoned because the costs of maintaining them were so high.\n\n\"You might be looking at 15 to 20 per cent of the boat's value in maintenance a year, so with rising living costs and berthing fees some people simply can't afford it.\"\n\nSelling boats was also more difficult these days, with them being classed as \"luxury items\".\n\nHe urged people to get onto the problem sooner than later, rather than abandoning them on random moorings.\n\n\"It is very irresponsible, and if you don't know the strength of the mooring the boat could be blown off in a storm.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["aucklands", "ghost", "ships", "number", "of", "abandoned", "vessels", "surge", "and", "boaties", "are", "footing", "the", "bill", "hundreds", "litter", "waters", "require", "recovery", "costing", "ratepayers", "thousands", "dollars"], "tags": ["Lower Hutt", "Kaikohe", "The Front Page", "Stratford", "Shop home & living", "Rail holidays", "All Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Motueka", "Napier", "Auckland", "International travel", "TV", "Palmerston North", "Shop fashion", "Property Insider", "All Wellington", "Coromandel & Hauraki", "Hastings", "Tasman", "Far North", "Shop entertainment", "Adventure travel", "Europe", "Health", "Middle East", "Health & wellbeing", "Asia", "Editorials", "Otago / Queenstown", "Wairarapa", "Australia", "USA", "Pacific", "Whakat\u0101ne", "Wanaka", "On the Tiles", "New Plymouth", "The Great NZ Road Trip", "Kapiti", "Te Awamutu", "Upper Hutt", "Ashburton", "Recipe collections", "Rural technology", "Analysis", "On The Up", "Opinion", "P\u0101p\u0101moa", "Pacific Islands", "Morning quiz", "Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Kea Kids news", "Dargaville", "Bay of Islands", "Central Hawke's Bay", "Whangarei", "Cambridge", "Otago", "Ask me Anything", "Open Justice", "Kaipara", "Taranaki", "Christchurch", "H\u0101wera", "Wellington", "Nelson-Tasman", "Letters to the editor", "Society Insider", "Dunedin", "Movies", "All Otago", "Restaurant reviews", "Luxury travel", "West Coast", "United States", "All Taranaki", "Invercargill", "Scam Update", "Te Puke", "Tauranga", "Queenstown", "Katikati", "Stewart Island", "Fashion & beauty", "Havelock North", "All Southland", "Shop beauty", "Pets & animals", "All Opinion", "Music reviews", "Milford's Investing Place", "Deloitte Top 200 Awards", "Movie reviews", "UK", "Book reviews", "Reviews", "New Zealand", "Premium opinion", "All Canterbury", "Matamata & Piako", "Taup\u014d & T\u016brangi", "Mount Maunganui", "Canterbury", "Culture", "Tokoroa & South Waikato", "Music", "Nelson", "Manawat\u016b", "Business analysis", "Ski holidays", "All Quizzes", "Sex & relationships", "Oamaru", "Gore", "Southland", "Social media", "Best NZ beaches", "Shop gifts", "Timaru", "Cartoons", "Afternoon quiz", "Sports quiz", "Animal health", "Kerikeri", "Rowing", "NZ Open", "Food & drink", "Africa", "AI", "Mangawhai", "Balclutha", "Books", "Cruise holidays", "Marlborough", "Kaik\u014dura", "Northland", "Quizzes", "Wairoa", "Cooking the Books", "Alexandra", "Hamilton", "Horowhenua", "The Little Things"], "authors": ["Michael"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hundreds of ghost ships litter Auckland's waters and require recovery, costing ratepayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
