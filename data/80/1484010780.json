And by ending the unrivalled position of marriage we have helped to create the space for deeper discussions about giving legal recognition to other types of personal and caring relationships, such as those between friends, siblings and co-parents.\u201d\n\nQuick Guide Explainer: civil partnerships Show Civil partnerships were created in 2004 as a means of allowing same-sex couples to enter into a union that guarantees them similar legal rights to those who are married. They were limited to same-sex couples but in October 2018, following a supreme court ruling declaring the existing position discriminatory, the government announced that heterosexual couples would also be entitled to enter the arrangement. There are differences between the two forms of union, partially symbolic and partially matters of substance. For a marriage, the ceremony is solemnised by the couple saying a prescribed form of words; in a civil partnership, the couple can simply sign a document. Marriages can be conducted through either a civil or religious ceremony, at a registry office, church or wherever a venue is licensed. Civil partnerships are secular events, although partners can choose to hold a religious ceremony on the day. Civil partners cannot declare, for legal purposes, that they are married. Civil partnership certificates include the names of both parents of the parties whereas marriage certificates in England and Wales include only the names of a couple's fathers \u2013 for the time being. In terms of annulment the rules are virtually identical, although the clause that permits a marriage to be dissolved if one partner is 'suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form' does not apply to civil partnerships. Likewise, adultery can be grounds for a married couple to divorce though it cannot be relied upon to end a civil partnership.\n\nThose in civil partnerships and those who are married enjoy the same tax breaks and benefits \u2013 such as the marriage allowance and bereavement payments. Surviving civil partners are treated the same as widows or widowers in terms of rights to state pension.\n\nWhile those who are married and in civil partnerships enjoy extensive legal rights, those who are merely cohabiting \u2013 3.3 million couples at the last estimate \u2013 have no legal protections or property rights if one of them dies.

Thank you for your feedback.\n\nThe couple were joined for the registration by their two children, Eden, four, and Ariel, two, and their parents and friends who acted as witnesses.\n\nAfterwards, they described what had happened inside the register officer as a \u201cvery stripped back,\u201d simple process, for which they had paid the statutory minimum fee of \u00a346.\n\nThere was no ceremony as such, they added, but they had taken the opportunity to say a few words to each other in front of their children that had been \u201cskipped out on\u201d in the course of five years of campaigning.\n\nLater, they adjourned for a simple family lunch at a nearby pub, before planning to host a New Year\u2019s Eve party at which friends were invited \u201cto bring the food that they love to cook or makes them feel loved up.\u201d\n\nThe journey had not come without a significant personal cost, as Keiden spoke candidly about the toll on his mental health.\n\n\u201cAgainst all odds, we succeeded in a legal battle against the government and then, they did what we asked for all along. Not many people can say that.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we both know with everything gained, some things risk being lost, or at least unspoken. Through this long journey and hard-fought battle, our mental health has suffered, our ability to be civil to each other has been tested, and, crucially, we missed out on that important moment to state clearly what we mean to each other \u2013 not just what we\u2019ve become in the eyes of others,\u201d he said.\n\nElaborating on that later in an interview, he told of how he had started to feel very tired earlier this year \u201cin ways I couldn\u2019t explain\u201d after their historic court win.\n\n\u201cI think that I just burn out both physically and mentally. I spoke to the doctor and employers and took five weeks off work to really just take time to recover from the thing we have been through. I am glad I was able to do it and I think the conversation about mental health has changed in society in the last few years and have allowed me to accept that we are not as formidable as we think.\u201d\n\nThose involved in the couple\u2019s campaign said they were aware of as many as 80 other civil partnership ceremonies happening around the country on Tuesday, and there were believed to be many more.\n\nThe academics, who live in Hammersmith, west London, suffered defeat at the court of appeal but were given the go-ahead for a supreme court hearing in August 2017.\n\nThe panel of supreme court justices, including the court\u2019s president, Lady Hale, heard the couple\u2019s case in May 2018, and the judges later held that the Civil Partnership Act 2004 was incompatible with human rights laws on discrimination and family life.\n\nThe minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, said: \u201cCongratulations to all the couples who are having their civil partnerships today. I am proud that we have helped give thousands across the country the option to have a civil partnership and celebrate their union in a way that works for them.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60342115f3453f6630a3a441229b7329d52943/0_335_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d2812940486322a5dae5d496ac2c4145", "height": 720}, "title": "Couple who won battle to open up civil unions register partnership", "description": "Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan \u2018formalise relationship\u2019 in London registry office", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benquinn", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T19:30:03.000Z", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2019-12-31T15:04:33.000Z", "tag": "Civil partnerships,UK news,Marriage,Family"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BenQuinn75", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf60342115f3453f6630a3a441229b7329d52943/0_335_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=d2ca1a401fbcbdf3f32970b7c17cde2d", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/couple-who-won-battle-to-open-up-civil-unions-register-partnership"}
