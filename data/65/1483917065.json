Acrobat. pic.twitter.com/ybwVBXjYt6 \u2014 OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 1, 2020 Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.42 CET Neal Maupay and Alireza Jahanbakhsh speak.\n\nNM: It\u2019s a massive point for us. It\u2019s a busy period, we had a lot of games. I am very happy for the team and happy for Ali\u2019s goal. I think we controlled the whole game and they are a good team so we are quite happy with the point. AJ: It is a great feeling to be involved with such important games. I have been working hard. It has been a long time coming but I am happy to help the team. It has been a hard time for me and I am happy to turn it around. It has been tough. I had a good feeling. The last game and now this game, I had a feeling I could make the difference. When Dunky gave me the ball I tried to hit it as hard as possible and then the only thing was the bicycle kick. I have done it and it went in the right direction, I think it was the best goal of my career. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.33 CET Safe to say that Alireza Jahanbakhsh has scored the goal of the decade so far, with apologies to Jack Grealish. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.28 CET Final score: Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa. Great news for Dean Smith and a poor result for Sean Dyche. Share Updated at 15.28 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.26 CET Final score: Brighton 1-1 Chelsea Jahanbakhsh\u2019s goal deserves the plaudits. It was spectacular, and a deserved equaliser for Brighton who took the game to Chelsea, who suffered somewhat after Graham Potter made some attacking changes. Chelsea slackened off rather too much; Frank Lampard is likely to be peeved at his team\u2019s performance but relieved at the full-time whistle. FT: Brighton 1-1 Chelsea\n\n\n\nA dramatic finish with a superb Jahanbakhsh goal resucing a point for Brighton. https://t.co/lNndlO49xX \u2014 Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) January 1, 2020 Share Updated at 15.30 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.24 CET Full-time: Cheers as Reece James is booked for fouling Trossard. It sets up the last kick of the game, a free-kick chance from the edge of the area. Lewis Dunk takes it and it\u2019s too tame to beat Kepa. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.23 CET 90+4 min: Might Kovacic have been sent off? Trossard had spun away and that looked a tactical foul, and the Croatian had been booked. Lenient from the referee. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.22 CET 90+3 min: There\u2019s been some four minutes added on and the action has only just got more frenzied. Hudson-Odoi almost made amends for his earlier miss by heading back across goal for Abraham only for Webster to read the intentions and clear. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.20 CET 90 min: Some handbags. The ball, and not the game, had gone flat so a drop-ball is called. Maupay chose to contest it, which is against the rules these days and is thus booked. No, I didn\u2019t know that rule, either. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.19 CET 89 min: Kepa saves Chelsea! The ball came in from the right and Maupay had chance to score from eight yards out. He did everything right but Kepa had also guessed right, making a fine save with his legs and knocking the ball back out from danger. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.17 CET 88 min: What a chance for Chelsea, and what a peeved expression from Frank. Abraham worked the space for Hudson-Odoi, who had the whole goal begging but missed. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.16 CET 87 min: It was the classic overhead kick, by the way. Like Rooney v Manchester City, and perhaps with a little less shin involved. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.15 CET 85 min: Jahanbakhsh took 18 months to score his first Brighton goal and then, jusy days later, followed it up with one of the best of the season. That was spectacular. Chelsea are still reeling from it, and Frank Lampard again looks peeved. View image in fullscreen Jahanbakhsh\u2019s overhead classic. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Share Updated at 15.28 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.14 CET Goal! Brighton 1-1 Chelsea (Jahanbakhsh, 84) What an overhead kick from Jahanbakhsh! Dunk won the header and he launches it into the net. View image in fullscreen Alireza Jahanbakhsh scores with a spectacular goal. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters Share Updated at 15.21 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.12 CET 82 min: Trossard, Sussex\u2019s answer to Eden Hazard, tries some kind of Gordon Strachan-esque free-kick routine. He plays a short one, then hits the resultant pass, a moving ball, away from everyone. Wasteful. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.11 CET 81 min: Connolly has been a livewire and it is his defiance that forces another attack from which Maupay is fouled by a Kovacic for another yellow card. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.09 CET 80 min: Close! Brighton have a free-kick, taken by Trossard. Connolly controls the ball in a tight space and then turns to scuff a shot that Kepa has to deal with. That\u2019s as close as Brighton have come. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.08 CET 78 min: Connolly at last gets some space but then he loses his touch at a vital moment and the ball spills off for a throw. Brighton have suffered rather for a lack of composure. Montoya shows the same by smashing the ball willy nilly when a cross needed to caressed rather than walloped. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.06 CET 76 min: Tammy Abraham takes a kick where the sun doesn\u2019t shine - unless you are an advocate of perineum sunning - from Bernardo in a clash by the sideline. Hopefully not too much harm done. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.04 CET 74 min: Callum Hudson-Odoi comes off the left and looks to have an open chance at goal, only for Adam Webster to smell the danger and clear. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.03 CET 73 min: Jahanbakhsh swings and misses the target as the ball spills. He cannot help but lean back and screw the ball wide. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.02 CET 72 min: Chelsea\u2019s free-kick after that Dunk foul drifts out of play. Off goes Mason Mount, and he will be replaced by Kovacic, who will try and protect the defence a little more than Mount might be capable of. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 15.00 CET 70 min: Nice skill from Bernardo got Jahanbakhsh away but the Iranian was rather less than speedy. The breakdown of that move allows Tammy Abraham to buy Lewis Dunk the second booking of the game. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.59 CET 69 min: First booking sees Zouma pile into Connolly and bounce the Irishman off his feet. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.58 CET 68 min: Brighton change: Jahanbakhsh on for Mooy. That suggests Graham Potter sees speed being off the essence. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.56 CET 66 min: First Chelsea sub: off goes Pulisic, who did OK, for Callum Hudson-Odoi, who is still yet to show his best since coming back from that admittedly awful injury. Both players may have the spectre of Wilfried Zaha to contend with if those transfer types are right. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.54 CET 64 min: Jorginho makes an error in midfield and Maupay has the chance to play in Connolly, whose legs are pumping, only for Rudiger to come across. At the other end, James\u2019 shot is deflected after Pulisic and Mount set up an attack. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.52 CET 63 min: This game has heated up nicely. Not a huge amount of quality but there is a competitive edge. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.51 CET 61 min: Rudiger enraged as he commits another foul on Connolly. His ire is not with the ref but Tammy Abraham for being too loose with the ball. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.49 CET 60 min: Mooy tries to get the speed of Connolly away but Reece James shows real defensive anticipation in realising the danger and running the ball out of play for a goal kick. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.48 CET 59 min: Brighton forge on but Propper\u2019s attempt at a cross swerves behind. In truth, the final ball has been poor rather too often from them. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.47 CET 58 min: Kante fires in a snap shot that is saved by Ryan. Chances and openings at both ends now. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.46 CET 57 min: Near daylight for Trossard, only for the Belgian to overrun the ball. There\u2019s disappointment among the home fans over that one. That combo of Trossard, Maupay and Connolly carries a threat. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.45 CET 55 min: Pulisic appears to be the out-ball of choice for Chelsea and he shows off his party trick in cutting inside, and blamming an effort at goal. And it\u2019s wide this time. View image in fullscreen Another effort from the dangerous Christian Pulisic. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA Share Updated at 14.51 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.43 CET 53 min: A rare Chelsea sojourn, with Azpilicueta on the burst. It comes to nothing. Then Rudiger is accused of a handball from a long pass forward for Dunk for Connolly...but Chelsea get an attack away and Pulisic powers the ball into the arms of Mat Ryan. Signs are that this is opening up. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.41 CET 52 min: Chelsea have been unsettled by Brighton\u2019s energy though Albion have not exactly threaded much together themselves. This game has betrayed the bleariness of the time of year; there is too much football. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.40 CET 50 min: Connolly now chases down Rudiger. Good work from him. The plan appears to be stopping Chelsea being able to settle and Connolly is one of those players ideal for that approach, a ratter. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.38 CET 49 min: Rudiger fouls Connolly by the touchline, with the young Irishman showing admirable strength for someone who is giving away at least half a foot in height. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.37 CET 47 min: The belief appears that Chelsea can be got at so Brighton are going to try and attack. The opening moments, though, have been cagey. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.35 CET 46 min: They are back underway and Graham Potter has made an adventurous change: on comes Aaron Connolly for Yves Bissouma. Brighton go for something approaching 4-4-2. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.20 CET Half-time: Brighton 0-1 Chelsea Chelsea closed out the half on the attack, just as they began it but they were under pressure from a Brighton side that got better as the game went on and once Graham Potter made a tactical change. Cesar Azpilicueta\u2019s goal separates the two teams. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.18 CET 45+2 min: Reece James still getting booed. Kante creates space and his switch of play gives Pulisic the chance to ping a shot on goal, just wide of Mat Ryan\u2019s dive and the left-hand post. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.17 CET 45 min: Three added minutes, mostly for that shoulder injury for poor Dan Burn. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.16 CET 44 min: Brighton have gone like for like on Chelsea and look to have the stronger team at this point. Some ragged defending blocks off the excellent Maupay from having a chance. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.15 CET 43 min: Brighton go close! Maupay goes down the channel and lays up Trossard, whose shot is whipped across goal and Kepa has to make a full-length save. Montoya\u2019s attempt at the rebound goes wide. View image in fullscreen Kepa Arrizabalaga makes a decent save from Trossard. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters Share Updated at 14.20 CET\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.13 CET 41 min: Aston Villa are 2-0 up on Burnley and Jack Grealish does have his goal this time. Life during VARtime can be terribly confusing. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.12 CET 40 min: Brighton continue to dominate possession without ever looking like creating danger. Pulisic works back well to break up play and the pitchside mic catches a bit of his American twang. Share\n\n1 Jan 2020 14.10 CET 38 min: Chelsea trying to slow things down and take the sting out of a resurgent Brighton, though the home team do look a little short on the final ball. They are rather less than poised.
