One Twitter user wrote: \u201cWhat the pope did demonstrates one thing \u2013 he\u2019s a man.\u201d\n\nIn his address on Wednesday morning, the pope also condemned violence against women. He said: \u201cBy how we treat a woman\u2019s body, we can understand our level of humanity.\u201d\n\nIn another clip that went viral in 2019, Pope Francis repeatedly yanked his hand away from being kissed as a long queue of people came up to him. The waiting pilgrims had been attempting to kiss his papal ring as part of a tradition, practised by more conservative Catholics, to show respect to the pontiff. A few days after the incident, the Vatican said Francis had been worried about spreading germs. However, experts said at the time that his reluctance to have his papal ring kissed reflected an uneasiness with an element of traditional protocol that had lost its original meaning.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Pontiff admits \u2018sometime even I lose patience\u2019, referring to incident with pilgrim at Vatican", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Pontiff admits \u2018sometime even I lose patience\u2019, referring to incident with pilgrim at Vatican", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c7e75eaf6bdbac19dd966129af04c2c28c4ae1f/62_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f6d187bc80dad0d17ca84079f10182b6", "height": 720}, "title": "Pope Francis apologises after slapping woman's hand", "description": "Pontiff admits \u2018sometime even I lose patience\u2019, referring to incident with pilgrim at Vatican", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-giuffrida", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T15:41:53.000Z", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-01-01T14:43:25.000Z", "tag": "Pope Francis,Catholicism,Christianity,Religion,The papacy,World news,Vatican,Italy,Europe"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c7e75eaf6bdbac19dd966129af04c2c28c4ae1f/62_0_1875_1125/master/1875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=f9cba2aeebf9e2640e43d10c94c9693b", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/01/pope-francis-apologises-after-slapping-womans-hand"}
