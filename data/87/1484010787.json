Jenkins also denied Jones\u2019 request to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nAn attorney for Jones did not immediately comment Tuesday. Jenkins\u2019 orders were first reported by The Daily Beast.\n\nJones operates Infowars in Texas. He is fighting similar lawsuits in Connecticut brought by other families of Sandy Hook victims for promoting a theory that the shooting was a hoax. A 20-year-old gunman killed 20 first-graders, six educators and himself at the school, after having killed his mother at their Newtown home.\n\nThe families said they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones\u2019 followers because of the hoax conspiracy.\n\nJones has since acknowledged that the Sandy Hook killings occurred. His attorneys have defended his speech in court as \u201crhetorical hyperbole\u201d and deny it was defamation.\n\nIn June, the father of six-year-old Noah Pozner, one of the Sandy Hook victims, won a defamation lawsuit against the authors of a book that claimed the shooting never happened.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Infowars host used his show to promote the theory that the shooting, which killed 20 children and six educators, was a hoax", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Infowars host used his show to promote the theory that the shooting, which killed 20 children and six educators, was a hoax", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5024bc594a465db9c327e9adf9fdfa39914f10c1/0_5_4275_2565/master/4275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0f7bb56c1d4169516f756b245f488dad", "height": 720}, "title": "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones ordered to pay $100,000 in Sandy Hook case", "description": "Infowars host used his show to promote the theory that the shooting, which killed 20 children and six educators, was a hoax", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Associated Press", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T20:32:23.000Z", "section": "US news", "published_time": "2019-12-31T22:22:19.000Z", "tag": "Newtown shooting,US school shootings,Gun crime,Media,Texas,US news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5024bc594a465db9c327e9adf9fdfa39914f10c1/0_5_4275_2565/master/4275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=6bc25f2db2f3b8fa3522ef0f29d1285c", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory"}
