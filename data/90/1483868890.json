Photograph: Margaret McLaughlin\n\nA 19-year-old man became the first person to die on Ireland\u2019s roads this year when his car was involved in a collision in Co Derry at around 2.30am on New Year\u2019s Day.\n\nMichael \u00d3g McKenna, from the Maghera area, was fatally injured in the incident on the Moneysharvan Road between Maghera and Swatragh.\n\nThe woman driving the other car and two teenage passengers were taken to hospital to be treated for their injuries, which were not believed to be life threatening.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) appealed to anyone who witnessed or has information about the crash to contact them on 101.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe young man's death came as the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and the PSNI published figures which showed that more than 200 people were killed on Irish roads last year \u2013 148 in the State and 54 in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe figure for the State represented a 4 per cent increase on the 142 fatalities recorded on the roads in 2018, which RSA chairwoman Liz O\u2019Donnell said was \u201cdeeply saddening\u201d. The figure for 2018 was the lowest since records began in 1959.\n\n\u201cWe must respond to this increase the same way we have responded to previous setbacks. Rather than being disheartened, it should spur us and our road safety partners into renewed effort,\u201d Ms O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nDrivers accounted for the highest number of road users who died last year at 81 with 27 pedestrians, 16 passengers, 16 motorcyclists and eight pedal cyclists dying as a result of incidents on the roads. The number of fatal collisions increased from 135 to 137 year on year.\n\nThe number of road deaths in the State has been consistently under 200 since 2010.\n\n\u2018Greater responsibility\u2019\n\nMinister for Transport Shane Ross said \u201cthe only way to respond to these needless deaths and injuries on our roads is through action, not words\u201d and he urging road users to take \u201cgreater responsibility\u201d for their actions.\n\n\u201cWe can do this by slowing down, not driving while impaired through drink, drugs or fatigue, by not driving while using a phone, by wearing a seatbelt and always sharing the road more carefully with pedestrians and cyclists.\u201d\n\nThe PSNI said the 54 people killed on Northern Ireland\u2019s road last year was the second lowest since records began in 1931.\n\nThe figure has been falling each year since 2014, when 79 people died and was one fewer that the total for 2018.\n\nTwenty-six of those who died in road incidents last year in the North were drivers, with fifteen pedestrians, eight passengers in cars, three motorcyclists and two cyclists also dying on the roads.\n\nPSNI Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said that despite the downward trend \u201cfar too many people\u201d are killed on Northern Ireland\u2019s roads every year.\n\n\u201cThe simple reality is that many collisions can be avoided,\u201d he said. \u201cNot paying full attention, poor positioning on the road, excess speed for the conditions and people driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs remain the most common causes of the most serious collisions which kill and injure people.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAs we start a new year, please resolve to have a greater focus on road safety, so we can prevent collisions and save lives.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["road-safety-authority"], "tags": ["Road Safety Authority", "Pricewatch", "Beauty"], "authors": ["Freya Mcclements", "Freya Mcclements Is Northern Editor Of The Irish Times", "Shauna Bowers", "Shauna Bowers Is Health Correspondent Of The Irish Times", "Wed Jan -"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Driver of other car and two teenage passengers taken to hospital for treatment", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/pf/resources/favicon.ico?d=178", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Driver of other car and two teenage passengers taken to hospital for treatment", "twitter": {"description": "Driver of other car and two teenage passengers taken to hospital for treatment", "title": "Man (19) dies after New Year\u2019s Day car crash in Co Derry", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/2KTIWPNC3D24TOSBNQECPJQWNM.jpg?smart=true&auth=b4ba1abf7ca0a46c6c3192eb935fd96e7aa5eb6459e726d0db7dc40829ef61ba&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "The scene of a fatal crash near Maghera, Co Derry, where a 19-year-old man was killed.
