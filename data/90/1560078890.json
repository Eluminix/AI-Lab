Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, the Philippines, Syria and South Sudan fall into that category.\n\nNot only would such outbreaks tax already stretched health services, they could also result in more deaths and greater suffering.\n\n\u201cAt a time like this, these countries can ill-afford to face additional outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases\u201d, asserted the UNICEF chief.\n\n\u201cThe message is clear: We must not allow lifesaving health interventions to fall victim to our efforts to address COVID-19\u201d.\n\nUNICEF is committed to supporting basic health care and immunization needs in the worst affected countries in a way that limits the risk of COVID-19 transmission, by working to ensure adequate vaccine supplies in countries that need them.\n\nThe agency is working with global vaccine suppliers to ensure production, and providing support to governments to maintain vaccine supplies during the pandemic.\n\nPhysical distancing is leading parents to make the difficult decision to defer routine immunization\n\nPlan ahead\n\nWhile Governments may have to temporarily postpone mass vaccination campaigns to ensure that delivering immunizations does not contribute to spreading the coronavirus, UNICEF \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d that Governments begin \u201crigorous planning now\u201d, to intensify immunization programmes once the pandemic is under control.\n\n\u201cThese vaccination activities must focus on children who will miss vaccine doses during this period of interruption and prioritize the poorest and most vulnerable children\u201d, Ms. Fore explained.\n\nTo successfully roll-out an effective vaccine against COVID-19, when it becomes available, immunization programmes must remain robust and accessible to those that most need inoculations.\n\n\u201cAs the world's biggest buyer and supplier of vaccines, UNICEF will continue to play a pivotal role in supporting governments\u2019 current and future immunization efforts\u201d, the UNICEF chief concluded.\n\nStudents missing out\n\nMeanwhile, as nationwide school closures disrupt education for more than 80 per cent of students around the world, UNICEF announced that it would scale up support in 145 nations to help learning continue, safely.\n\n\u201cIt is an unprecedented situation and unless we collectively act now to protect children\u2019s education, societies and economies will feel the burden long after we\u2019ve beaten COVID-19\u201d, said Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Global Chief of Education. \u201cIn the most vulnerable communities, the impact will span generations\u201d.\n\nBased on lessons learned with the school closures in response to the Ebola epidemics of recent years, UNICEF maintains that the longer children stay away from school, the less likely they are to ever return.\n\nGiving children alternative ways to learn also rebuilds a routine, which is critical to the coronavirus response.\n\nUNICEF has allocated $13 million to support Governments and education partners to develop plans for a rapid, system-wide response to include alternative learning programmes and mental health support.",
