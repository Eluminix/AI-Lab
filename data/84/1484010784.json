RB Leipzig\u2019s Dayot Upamecano and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Thomas Lemar would be fine additions but would cost, in total, around \u00a3100m and Arsenal simply do not have that money. A January of wheeling and dealing looks more likely: Granit Xhaka\u2019s departure would, if given the green light, free up around \u00a325m but big-money additions might be contingent on letting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leave \u2013 a sacrifice that may not be worth it. Nick Ames\n\nAston Villa\n\nAfter spending over \u00a3100m in the summer, Villa can ill afford to go down. But they realise they will probably have to spend again if they are to blast their way out of relegation trouble. A new striker to relieve the pressure on Wesley would be welcome, and there is also a desire to improve the supply to the forward line, especially with John McGinn out for three months with injury. The Werder Bremen winger Milot Rashica is among the targets. Paul Doyle\n\nBournemouth\n\nEddie Howe has repeatedly cited the difficulty of getting value for money in the winter window but a sizeable injury list may force his hand. The priority will be keeping hold of Nathan Ak\u00e9, though they are powerless to stop him joining Chelsea should his former club activate a \u00a340m buyback clause this month. Ryan Fraser is out of contract in June but the club have no desire to cash in on the winger this window, while Howe could recall the striker Sam Surridge from Swansea. Ben Fisher\n\nView image in fullscreen Bournemouth\u2019s Nathan Ak\u00e9 could be heading back to Chelsea if his former club choose to activate the \u00a340m buyback clause in his contract. Photograph: Jed Leicester/BPI/Shutterstock\n\nBrighton\n\nA lack of cutting edge in attack has cost Brighton dearly in recent weeks and Graham Potter is likely to be in the market for another striker to take the strain off Neal Maupay and the veteran Glenn Murray, who has made only three Premier League starts this campaign. They have also been linked with rising Norwegian star Emil Bohinen - the son of former Nottingham Forest midfielder Lars - and Bordeaux right-back Enock Kwateng but do not expect wholesale changes to a squad still adapting to their new manager. Ed Aarons\n\nBurnley\n\nHave been linked with Championship players such as Josh Brownhill of Bristol City and Ollie Watkins from Brentford. Sean Dyche is always on the lookout for inexpensive upgrades and has done well in the past few seasons, though Danny Drinkwater could return to Chelsea in January if Burnley choose not to extend his loan deal. Burnley need to keep Dwight McNeil at the club a little longer, and to think about back up for Ashley Barnes now that Dyche has begun to ration his starts. Paul Wilson\n\nChelsea\n\nFrank Lampard has at least \u00a3150m to spend now the club\u2019s transfer ban has been lifted and he wants to improve his attacking options. Targets include Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, Villarreal winger Samuel Chukwueze, CSKA Moscow forward Fyodor Chalov, Timo Werner of RB Leipzig, Lyon\u2019s Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Wilfried Zaha, while Chelsea could also make a \u00a340m move for the Bournemouth defender Nathan Ak\u00e9. Olivier Giroud will be allowed to leave. Jacob Steinberg\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nRoy Hodgson\u2019s pleas for reinforcements to his battle-weary squad look likely to fall on deaf ears with Crystal Palace\u2019s American owners reluctant to increase a wage bill which is in the Premier League\u2019s top 10. Yet given the shortage in attacking options and a number of injuries in defence, new arrivals are surely needed if Palace are to maintain their upward trajectory. The prospective departure of Wilfried Zaha would free up some funds although it remains to be seen whether Chelsea or any other suitors for the Ivorian will meet the asking price of \u00a380m. EA\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace\u2019s Wilfried Zaha has attracted a lot of suitors but his \u00a380m asking price remains a deterrent.

A goalscorer and a creative midfielder will be high on the wish list. PW\n\nLeicester\n\nThe priority is a surefire winger or two ready to go straight into the team while the likes of Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray develop consistency. The club has plenty to spend if necessary, including the \u00a380m they got last summer for Harry Maguire. None of their top players will be sold, while the squad may be pruned, with fringe players such as Nampalys Mendy possible departures. PD\n\nLiverpool\n\nQuite clearly do not need anyone this January, unless J\u00fcrgen Klopp has concerns about outbreak of illness or injury, particularly as Takumi Minamino has already been signed from RB Salzburg. Just fitting the Japanese attacking midfielder into an already successful team will be tricky enough, and Klopp has said there is no need to rush because the present players are performing so well. While Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 might get straight into the Liverpool side, almost everyone else would have to wait. PW\n\nView image in fullscreen Takumi Minamino has a chat with J\u00fcrgen Klopp on his first day at Liverpool\u2019s training ground. Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nManchester City\n\nPep Guardiola has insisted that no one will be signed despite how Aymeric Laporte\u2019s injury and the lack of any quality replacement for the centre-back have hurt the title defence. The Frenchman is expected back for the Champions League which may now be the main focus. As this is the transfer market, though, never say never regarding a U-turn in policy and Guardiola would have up to \u00a350m should this occur. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s budget is around \u00a3150m but only for players on his summer list who become available. This includes Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, Leicester\u2019s James Maddison, Tottenham\u2019s Christian Eriksen or West Ham\u2019s Declan Rice. The manager, though, should prioritise Rice, Eriksen, Maddison or another midfielder as this is his weakest department. No one should leave unless, say, Nemanja Matic demands a move and the offer is good. JJ\n\nNewcastle\n\nIf mid-table security is to be cemented, Steve Bruce could do \u2013 rather desperately \u2013 with a reliable striker, thereby reducing his dependence on defenders for goalscoring. Bruce needs to sell to buy and hopes to offload midfielders Jack Colback and Henri Saivet, who together earn almost \u00a3100,000 a week and are not in the 25-man first-team squad. Dwight Gayle could be sold to a Championship club while Yoshinori Muto and Ki Sung-yueng could also be offloaded. Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen is Bruce\u2019s main target. Louise Taylor\n\nView image in fullscreen Hull City\u2019s Jarrod Bowen (right) is a priority target for Steve Bruce at Newcastle. Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/Shutterstock\n\nNorwich\n\nNorwich\u2019s injury crisis has ended but one glaring hole remains; someone to take the load off Teemu Pukki up front. That this is the most expensive position to reinforce, and Norwich insist they cannot spend \u00a310m on a player, means even links to young talents such as Willem II\u2019s Mike Tr\u00e9sor Ndayishimiye will likely come to nothing. The upside is that there is no pressure to sell either, despite interest in Max Aarons and Ben Godfrey. Paul MacInnes\n\nSheffield United\n\nChris Wilder is well stocked for forwards but has tended to rely on the same players every week in other positions. He would welcome more strength in depth, especially in midfield and defence. He has a longstanding interest in the Blackburn Rovers centre-back Darragh Lenihan, while Nottingham Forest\u2019s Joe Worrall is also on the radar. Sheffield United\u2019s abundance of forwards, meanwhile, has restricted the playing time of Billy Sharp, in whom clubs including Celtic have expressed an interest.

Soares is out of contract in the summer and happy to run his contract down, while Bertrand could also depart at the end of the season. Hasenh\u00fcttl is desperate to spruce up his defence with a couple of new faces capable of making an immediate impact. BF\n\nTottenham\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho has said on several occasions that he understands the financial constraints at Spurs; that he is happy to work with the existing squad. Does anybody truly believe His Humbleness? In an ideal world, Mourinho would like new full-backs, maybe a centre-back and a back-up striker. Whether the club can sell Christian Eriksen will hold the key to the budget. Mourinho\u2019s first window with Daniel Levy will be an experience. David Hytner\n\nWatford\n\nRecent results and performances have reinforced the belief that Watford already have the players they need to get out of their current predicament, though the defence, weakened by injuries, could be reinforced. Jo\u00e3o Pedro, whose transfer was agreed last year, has arrived from Fluminense but at 18 cannot be expected to have an instant impact. Major outgoings are unlikely though some seldom-used squad members, particularly goalkeepers and midfielders, will leave on loan. Simon Burnton\n\nView image in fullscreen Jo\u00e3o Pedro has arrived at Watford but at only 18 it could be asking a lot for him to turn their season around. Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWest Ham\n\nDavid Moyes wants to spend after being tasked with saving West Ham from relegation again. A central midfielder has to be a priority and Moyes likes Stoke\u2019s Joe Allen. But there are other holes to fill. West Ham are trying to sign the Middlesbrough goalkeeper Darren Randolph and want more cover up front. JS\n\nWolves\n\nRising interest in Adama Traor\u00e9 is likely to be rebuffed. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo hopes to make a couple of additions to a squad that has coped admirably with its huge workload so far. The injury to Willy Boly means a new centre-back is high on the wish list, and Nuno would also like more options in midfield. A couple of Lille players have been eyed up \u2013 defender Gabriel Magalh\u00e3es and midfielder Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 - while Milan\u2019s Franck Kessi\u00e9 and QPR\u2019s versatile Ryan Manning have also attracted interest.
