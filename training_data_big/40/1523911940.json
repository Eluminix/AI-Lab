In the current coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has called for transparency.\n\nA senior Chinese health official said on Friday that 1 716 health workers have been infected by the coronavirus and six of them have died.\n\nReuters", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["#coronavirus"], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said", "keywords": "#coronavirus", "article": {"publisher": "https://iol.co.za", "published_time": 1582016220000, "author": "Lusha Zhang And Ryan Woo", "section": "News"}, "IE=edge": "X-UA-Compatible", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "4BE9A236252D15311B31D1EA103EE632", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "unsafe-url": "referrer", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "facebook-domain-verification": "m85xaz5xdy8fiifyys11g0z5i7e2b0", "og": {"title": "WATCH: Top hospital director dies of coronavirus in China's Wuhan", "description": "The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said", "url": "https://iol.co.za/news/2020-02-18-watch-top-hospital-director-dies-of-coronavirus-in-chinas-wuhan/", "site_name": "IOL", "locale": "en-ZA", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.2d0c9660.svg", "width": 331}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "WATCH: Top hospital director dies of coronavirus in China's Wuhan", "description": "The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, died of the disease on Tuesday, state television said", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.2d0c9660.svg", "width": 331}}}, "canonical_link": "https://iol.co.za/news/2020-02-18-watch-top-hospital-director-dies-of-coronavirus-in-chinas-wuhan/"}
