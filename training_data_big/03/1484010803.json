He indicated he would deny the charge.\n\nThe painting, Bust of a Woman, has been removed from display and is being assessed by conservation experts. Tate Modern declined to comment on the condition of the painting.\n\nA spokesperson for the gallery said a member of the public had attempted to damage a painting, and a suspect had been \u201cswiftly apprehended\u201d.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said in a statement: \u201cDetectives investigating an incident of criminal damage at the Tate Modern, Bankside, on Saturday 28 December have charged a man.\u201d\n\nMassey was denied bail and has been remanded in custody until a pre-trial hearing at Inner London crown court on 30 January.\n\nBust of a Woman was created in Paris in 1944 during the Nazi occupation. The semi-abstract work portrays the photographer Dora Maar, reportedly Picasso\u2019s lover, sitting on a metal chair wearing a hat and green clothing.\n\nTate Modern is the most popular visitor attraction in the UK, welcoming almost 5.9 million people in 2018. It offers a number of free exhibitions and has an extensive collection of international artworks.\n\nIn 2012, a prized Mark Rothko painting was vandalised at the gallery, for which a man was sentenced to two years in prison. Vladimir Umanets wrote his name and a statement about the visual movement Yellowism on the painting, claiming it was an artistic act.\n\nAt London\u2019s National Gallery in 1914, Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s Rokeby Venus was slashed by a suffragette, Mary Richardson, who was protesting against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst. The piece was restored and remains on display.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Molly Blackall"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Bust of a Woman was reportedly ripped while gallery was open to public on Saturday", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Bust of a Woman was reportedly ripped while gallery was open to public on Saturday", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a1c4e56e7507a71c294d5cfc203afab9aca5e2/27_447_6207_3724/master/6207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d334651e4777e02d159e835bce47fd28", "height": 720}, "title": "Man charged over damage to \u00a320m Picasso at Tate Modern", "description": "Bust of a Woman was reportedly ripped while gallery was open to public on Saturday", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/molly-blackall", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T19:30:01.000Z", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2019-12-31T16:07:03.000Z", "tag": "UK news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a1c4e56e7507a71c294d5cfc203afab9aca5e2/27_447_6207_3724/master/6207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=9f1463ca1693131325b06de5c1dd9aaf", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/man-charged-over-damage-to-20m-picasso-at-tate-modern"}
