This means little Marquis is believed to be the first baby born in Las Vegas not just in 2020, but also in the new decade.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018It\u2019s 12!\u2019 \u201d Marquis\u2019 mother, Latasha Atkinson, said from her hospital room. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 We were thinking it already because were were like it would be so cool if we had a New Year\u2019s baby. \u2026 We didn\u2019t think it was really going to happen.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMarquis\u2019 father, Marquis Johnson Sr., was, of course, thrilled to have a brand-new son \u2014 and to also know that the baby made history in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cShe was like, \u2018Maybe, maybe,\u2019 and so she probably spoke it into existence,\u201d Marquis Johnson Sr. said of the timing of his son\u2019s birth.\n\nAtkinson said she can\u2019t wait to tell her son about his arrival time into this world as he gets older.\n\n\u201cIt is cool \u2026 really cool,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something like, when he grows up, we are going to tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018You were the first decade baby!\u2019 \u201d Johnson Sr. chimed in. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be an amazing thing. He\u2019s going to have all the bragging rights \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m a superstar!\u2019 \u201d\n\nCyndi Lundeberg, spokeswoman for the hospital, said doctors and staffers were excited for the family as well.\n\n\u201cIt is super exciting any time we have a new baby at the hospital. Everyone we have, our doctors, our staff are extremely excited,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to have the first baby of the decade at Sunrise is truly amazing, and we could not be happier for our lovely parents.\u201d\n\nThe Las Vegas couple said they can\u2019t wait to get Marquis Jr. home to meet his two siblings.\n\n\u201cNothing but happiness,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nTo celebrate the birth, the family received a baby stroller \u201cfull of goodies,\u201d including baby supplies and onesies, Lundeberg said in a later email.\n\nA second baby was born 21 seconds after Marquis Jr. at MountainView Hospital, according to Lundeberg, who is director of marketing and communications for Southern Hills Hospital and Medical Center.\n\nThat baby, Roman Black, was born 58 seconds after midnight.
