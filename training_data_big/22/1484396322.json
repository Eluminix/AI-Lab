Sharks are not like a fly where if you stay still they will go away.\n\n\u2022 Don't wave your hands about as they can identify you as looking distressed.\n\n\u2022 Ignore the myth of punching a shark in the nose, you are better to go for the gill or an eye. This can give you more time to get away.\n\n\u2022 Don't grab a shark by the tail as it can swing around to bite you.\n\n\u2022 If a shark starts circling you that's a sign they are getting ready to attack - so get out of the water as quickly as possible.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["great", "white", "shark", "washes", "up", "on", "orewa", "beach", "27metre", "female", "juvenile", "washed", "after", "getting", "caught", "fishing", "net"], "tags": ["Central Hawke's Bay", "TV", "Marlborough", "The Front Page", "Taranaki", "Katikati", "Rowing", "USA", "Kea Kids news", "Adventure travel", "Nelson-Tasman", "Morning quiz", "Ski holidays", "NZ Open", "Rural technology", "Dunedin", "Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Middle East", "Stratford", "All Otago", "Europe", "Horowhenua", "Stewart Island", "New Zealand", "Property Insider", "Te Puke", "Analysis", "Kaikohe", "Matamata & Piako", "Tokoroa & South Waikato", "West Coast", "Quizzes", "Shop fashion", "Invercargill", "Opinion", "Palmerston North", "Upper Hutt", "All Canterbury", "Afternoon quiz", "Wanaka", "Auckland", "Cooking the Books", "Books", "Otago / Queenstown", "Recipe collections", "Movie reviews", "Book reviews", "UK", "Balclutha", "Kapiti", "Scam Update", "United States", "Music reviews", "Budget 2025", "Manawat\u016b", "Shop home & living", "Movies", "All Quizzes", "All Opinion", "Canterbury", "Whangarei", "Tauranga", "Society Insider", "Health", "Wellington", "Far North", "Business analysis", "Dargaville", "Africa", "Lower Hutt", "Music", "Restaurant reviews", "Mangawhai", "Shop beauty", "The Little Things", "Shop entertainment", "Milford's Investing Place", "Sex & relationships", "New Plymouth", "Premium opinion", "Napier", "Social media", "Health & wellbeing", "Otago", "Southland", "Mount Maunganui", "Motueka", "All Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Ashburton", "Gore", "Deloitte Top 200 Awards", "AI", "All Taranaki", "Nelson", "Tasman", "Asia", "Editorials", "Cambridge", "Cruise holidays", "Bay of Islands", "Cartoons", "Culture", "Rail holidays", "Oamaru", "Australia", "Taup\u014d & T\u016brangi", "Northland", "On The Up", "Sports quiz", "Coromandel & Hauraki", "Whakat\u0101ne", "Wairoa", "Open Justice", "P\u0101p\u0101moa", "All Wellington", "Animal health", "Pets & animals", "Letters to the editor", "Kerikeri", "Reviews", "All Southland", "H\u0101wera", "On the Tiles", "Hastings", "Queenstown", "Shop gifts", "Alexandra", "International travel", "Wairarapa", "Pacific", "Fashion & beauty", "Te Awamutu", "Best NZ beaches", "Luxury travel", "Christchurch", "Ask me Anything", "Kaipara", "Kaik\u014dura", "Havelock North", "Timaru", "Hamilton", "Food & drink", "Pacific Islands"], "authors": ["Emma Russell"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A 2.7-metre female juvenile great white shark has washed up on Orewa beach after getting caught in a fishing net.
