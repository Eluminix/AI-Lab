I don\u2019t know what is. A masterpiece!\u201d\n\nWhether she got into Berghain for her t-shirt or not, we\u2019ll wait to see whether the clothing drop materialises next month. Meanwhile, Calloway has been retweeting tweets about her Berghain visit, including one that read: \u201cCaroline Calloway cancelling Berghain is the biggest thing to happen to Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u201d\n\nCalloway has recently announced to her followers that she is campaigning for Bernie Sanders ahead of the 2020 US election. She is also due to release a book called Scammer this spring.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["art", "fashion", "film", "music", "ideas", "ideas sharing network", "dazed & confused", "dazed", "dazed & confused magazine", "dazed and confused", "dazed and confused magazine", "dazed+confused", "dazeddigital"], "tags": ["Coronavirus", "Berghain", "coronavirus", "Caroline Calloway"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "Thu Mar 12 11:56:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Four days later the club shut down due to coronavirus", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon.ico", "meta_data": {"author": "Dazed", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=6463440577", "keywords": "art,fashion,film,music,ideas,ideas sharing network,dazed & confused, dazed, dazed & confused magazine, dazed and confused, dazed and confused magazine,dazed+confused,dazeddigital", "description": "Four days later the club shut down due to coronavirus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 249814310818, "pages": 23596074088}, "ahrefs-site-verification": "debf75f21fc4e16fb832e869976daffd1a5752328ffd454d8f64fb19173c449e", "og": {"site_name": "Dazed", "title": "Caroline Calloway went to Berghain wearing a Corona t-shirt", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/48330/1/caroline-calloway-gets-into-berghain-wearing-a-corona-t-shirt-coronavirus", "image": "https://images-prod.dazeddigital.com/1080/0-202-1080-720/azure/dazed-prod/1280/7/1287651.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-03-12T11:56:00+00:00", "section": "Life & Culture"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Dazed", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/48330/1/caroline-calloway-gets-into-berghain-wearing-a-corona-t-shirt-coronavirus", "title": "Caroline Calloway went to Berghain wearing a Corona t-shirt", "image": "https://images-prod.dazeddigital.com/600/0-202-1080-720/azure/dazed-prod/1280/7/1287651.jpg", "description": "Four days later the club shut down due to coronavirus"}, "theme-color": "#222222"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/48330/1/caroline-calloway-gets-into-berghain-wearing-a-corona-t-shirt-coronavirus"}
