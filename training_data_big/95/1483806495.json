By any measure, these are horrible odds. And yet, I would bet many of us are feverishly putting the last finishing touches on our 2020 resolution list and maybe even giddily planning to indulge on the last binge of 2019 because starting January 1st everything will be totally different. Really?\n\nI found myself again in this predictably deluded state several weeks ago. After a few half-hearted contemplations about my New (i.e. same old) Year\u2019s resolutions, I decided defiantly that I\u2019m not going to do it this year. At least not in the same way I have always done it.\n\nI\u2019m tired of deluding myself and falling into the inevitable disappointment by the third week of January when work and home life are once again back in full force. Instead, I\u2019m going to treat the first day and every day of 2020 like any other day. I\u2019m setting daily (not full year!) resolutions.\n\nHere are some guidelines that can help you should you decide to forgo the old New Year\u2019s resolution tradition and really try something new this year.\n\nSet daily (not annual) goals . Goals have to be manageable in order to be repeatable. Repetition then becomes a habit. \u201cI will eat whole, healthy foods today,\u201d vs. \u201cI will become a healthy eater this year.\u201d\n\n. Goals have to be manageable in order to be repeatable. Repetition then becomes a habit. \u201cI will eat whole, healthy foods today,\u201d vs. \u201cI will become a healthy eater this year.\u201d Practice patience . \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with one step\u201d (Lao Tzu). Focus on the first 24-hour cycle, then the next, then the one after that.\n\n. \u201cA journey of a thousand miles begins with one step\u201d (Lao Tzu). Focus on the first 24-hour cycle, then the next, then the one after that. Praise effort instead of the outcome . \u201cI am moving in the right direction with my diet and exercise,\u201d vs. \u201cI lost 5 lbs!\u201d\n\n. \u201cI am moving in the right direction with my diet and exercise,\u201d vs. \u201cI lost 5 lbs!\u201d Focus on what you did right instead of wrong . \u201cI kept my cool most of the today,\u201d vs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I lost my patience!\u201d\n\n. \u201cI kept my cool most of the today,\u201d vs. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I lost my patience!\u201d Be your own best cheerleader . We really are our own worst critics. No wonder we struggle! The kinds of things we say to ourselves most of us would not dream of saying to others. So be nice to yourself, encourage yourself, and tell yourself what you would say to others who are striving to work harder and be better.\n\n. We really are our own worst critics. No wonder we struggle! The kinds of things we say to ourselves most of us would not dream of saying to others. So be nice to yourself, encourage yourself, and tell yourself what you would say to others who are striving to work harder and be better. Forgive yourself for missteps. I\u2019ve been practicing this one sporadically for many years. I find it especially helpful at the end of the day when my personal inner critic is at its worst having taken inventory of the day\u2019s activities and my inevitable shortcomings. It reminds me that I am human and fallible, which also makes me relatable to others from whom I receive and provide support.\n\nJust like the old New Year\u2019s resolutions, this new approach will not be perfect. But if part of the spirit of making resolutions is to try new things, then I think it\u2019s a worthy and even exciting endeavor. Here\u2019s to our daily striving together.\n\nHappy New Year!", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Are New Year's resolutions stressing you out?
