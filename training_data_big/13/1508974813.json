The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) is built on a trade treaty that promises to liberalise trade among African countries and create a single market for goods and services on the continent.\n\nThe treaty is expected to raise Africa\u2019s nominal gross domestic product (GDP) to $6.7 trillion by 2030 and liberalise 90 percent of products manufactured in Africa. For Nigeria, given its sheer market size, foreign direct investments will increase because of companies that will want to set up factories in the country. This will also lead to technology transfer.\n\nHowever, experts have raised concerns over Nigeria\u2019s preparedness to reap the benefits arising from the trade agreement without making the economy a dumping ground for sub-standard products. To attain this, Africa\u2019s biggest economy needs a robust quality assurance infrastructure to test products meant for export and those being imported from other countries into Nigeria.\n\n\u201cQuality assurance for made in Nigeria goods is critical if the country is to profitably participate in the continental trade agreement. As a country, we need to take our membership of the African Organisation of Standardisation (ARSO) seriously by ensuring strict compliance assessment standards. Quality sells,\u201d said Osita Aboloma, director-general, the Standard Organisation Nigeria (SON), represented by Mojisola Kehinde, director, Laboratory Services at the SON.\n\nThe AfCFTA officially came into force on 30th May 2019 when the required number of ratifications \u2013 22 \u2013 were obtained, making the agreement a binding international legal instrument. Negotiations are, however, on-going. After months of consultation and dilly-dallying, Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari signed the AfCFTA in July 2019, seeking fair trade for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is a most auspicious time to organise our business breakfast network on this theme given that most companies are having strategy sessions now to plan for the year. We intend our deliberation today on this continent-wide trade agreement to help companies better position themselves to take advantage by showing the role of conformity assessments and calibration in the quality of goods,\u201d Aliyu Abdullahi Angara, registrar and the chief executive officer of IPAN said.\n\nTo achieve accurate laboratory testing of products, experts say laboratories must have the necessary equipment to undertake the test it is required to carry out. Personnel must have adequate skills and competencies and laboratory equipment must be calibrated regularly. Laboratories are also encouraged to undertake inter-laboratory tests and proficiency testing.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s micro, small and medium enterprises need access to single-digit credit facilities, infrastructure and an easier environment to do business if they are to compete favourably. The MSMEs have really been orphans,\u201d Adebayo Olu-Adams, chairman Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME) told BusinessDay in an exclusive interview.\n\nShare", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Stephen Onyekwelu"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan 29 13:45:46 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Institute of Public Analysts of Nigeria (IPAN) at the second edition of its Business Network Breakfast Series (IBNBS) invited experts to explore...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-BD-logo-32x32.jpeg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "db301b720d4f9408699cce1e2b057636ca123d36": "db301b720d4f9408699cce1e2b057636ca123d36", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Institute of Public Analysts of Nigeria (IPAN) at the second edition of its Business Network Breakfast Series (IBNBS) invited experts to explore...", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Public Analysts show threats, opportunities AfCTA brings to economy - Businessday NG", "description": "The Institute of Public Analysts of Nigeria (IPAN) at the second edition of its Business Network Breakfast Series (IBNBS) invited experts to explore...", "url": "https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/nigerias-public-analysts-show-threats-opportunities-afcta-brings-to-economy/", "site_name": "Businessday NG", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/2020/01/Nigeria-to-sign-AfCFTA-trade-deal.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 563, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/businessdayng", "published_time": "2020-01-29T13:45:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-30T07:31:11+00:00"}, "author": "Stephen Onyekwelu", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@businessdayng", "site": "@businessdayng", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Stephen Onyekwelu", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.1", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-BD-logo-270x270.jpeg"}, "canonical_link": "https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/nigerias-public-analysts-show-threats-opportunities-afcta-brings-to-economy/"}
