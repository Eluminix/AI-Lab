Lorenzo provides the best bets you can make on each. USA TODAY\n\nA preview of the NFC wild-card matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and Philadelphia Eagles\n\nWhen: Sunday, Jan. 5, 4:40 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia\n\nChannel: NBC\n\nLine: Seahawks by 1\u00bd\n\nInjuries: Both teams are relatively banged up entering this one, with several key players who may or may not be able to play.\n\nThe Eagles recently lost starting right guard Brandon Brooks to a season-ending shoulder injury, while tight end Zach Ertz (ribs/back), running back Miles Sanders (ankle), wide receiver Nelson Agholor (knee) and right tackle Lane Johnson (ankle) missed all or part of the regular-season finale. Coach Doug Pederson said Monday the team would monitor their statuses throughout the week.\n\nSeattle, meanwhile, had 14 players on its injury report entering last week's game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Seahawks will be without starting linebacker Mychal Kendricks, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in one of his knees, but hope to get safety Quandre Diggs back for Sunday's game, according to coach Pete Carroll. They could also be thin at wide receiver with Jaron Brown (knee) out and Malik Turner questionable this week after suffering a concussion.\n\nTHREE THINGS TO KNOW\n\n1. Carries to be had: Few teams in the NFL embraced the run this season like the Seahawks and Eagles, who ranked third and seventh, respectively, in rushing attempts on the year. But injuries have put them in a similar predicament, trying to figure out who's going to get the carries. Philadelphia will hope for a healthy Sanders, lest they want to rely on Boston Scott for a second consecutive week. The Seahawks split carries between Marshawn Lynch (fresh out of retirement) and Travis Homer. With the cast of characters changing, it will be interesting to see if either team can establish consistent production on the ground.\n\n2. What's home worth? The Eagles (9-7) earned home-field advantage in this game by virtue of winning the lowly NFC East, even though the Seahawks finished with a better record (11-5, including a 7-1 mark on the road) and have generally played like the better team this year. (They also beat the Eagles, in Philadelphia, in Week 12.) If the Eagles manage to pull off the upset and win this one, it would illustrate the value of home-field advantage in the playoffs \u2014 and help fuel critics who say playoff seeding should be determined by record, regardless of division.\n\n3. All eyes on tight ends: One of the key matchups in this game will be Seattle's defense against Philadelphia's tight ends. The Seahawks ranked 31st in the NFL this year in catches (97) and receiving yards (1,099) surrendered to opposing tight ends, and Carson Wentz's top two targets are Ertz and Dallas Goedert. That pair combined for 146 catches, 1,523 receiving yards and 11 touchdowns during the regular season. All of this makes the health of Ertz that much more important in the days leading up to kickoff.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Tom Schad"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "After narrowly missing out on winning the NFC West, the Seahawks now must begin their playoff road in Philadelphia and face the Eagles.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/usatoday/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2020/01/01/seattle-seahawks-philadelphia-eagles-nfc-playoff-preview/2775642001/sports/nfl/playoffs", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Seattle Seahawks vs. Philadelphia Eagles wild-card playoff preview: Can Russell Wilson win again on road?", "description": "After narrowly missing out on winning the NFC West, the Seahawks now must begin their playoff road in Philadelphia and face the Eagles.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/12/31/USAT/df5bb70b-d6e8-4853-9ce3-45ae581a5730-USATSI_13707670.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2938,1653,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "After narrowly missing out on winning the NFC West, the Seahawks now must begin their playoff road in Philadelphia and face the Eagles.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/playoffs/2020/01/01/seattle-seahawks-philadelphia-eagles-nfc-playoff-preview/2775642001/"}
