Seven of the bodies were cremated in Britain before being repatriated, said the official Vietnam News Agency.\n\nThe first 16 of the bodies had been repatriated on Wednesday to their home towns in Vietnam where they were received by relatives and friends holding white roses.\n\nThe discovery of the bodies in the back of a refrigerated truck after being smuggled into Britain has shone a spotlight on the illicit trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the west.\n\nPolice in Vietnam have arrested 10 people in connection with the deaths. On Monday the British driver of the truck admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.\n\nIn Vietnam poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial rewards are all factors pushing people to leave.\n\nNguyen Dinh Gia, the father of victim Nguyen Dinh Luong, said his son had left home for Britain in \u201chopes for a better life\u201d.
