The nicotine-free policy, which includes e-cigarettes and vaping products, will go into effect in Arizona and 20 other states where the company operates starting Feb. 1. People hired before then won't be affected.\n\nThe Phoenix-based company, which employs around 4,000 people in Arizona and 30,000 across the U.S. and Canada, expects the policy will help create a more healthy corporate culture.\n\nU-Haul on Dec. 10 broke ground on a 54,208-square-foot conference and fitness center that will become a focal point of its campus at 2727 N. Central Ave.\n\nThe company also offers other programs including one focused on nutrition, fitness and other aspects of wellness.\n\nBetter health and lowest costs\n\nArizona is among 21 states where it is legal not to hire people who use nicotine, the company said. Arizona also is one of 17 states where employers can choose not hire and are allowed to test for nicotine, though U-Haul hasn't yet decided to do that.\n\n\"In our continued efforts to enhance our wellness program and decrease healthcare costs, we have become more aware of the medical side effects of using nicotine and tobacco products,\" said Jessica Lopez, U-Haul's chief of staff, in an email to The Arizona Republic.\n\n\"Taking care of our team members is the primary focus and goal\" of the new policy, she added. \"Decreasing healthcare costs will be a bonus.\"\n\nLopez said U-Haul carefully analyzed state and local laws and crafted the policy \"so as not to conflict with or violate any legal protections for nicotine users.\"\n\nU-Haul encourages staff members not to use nicotine by waiving a wellness fee that otherwise applies, she added. However, the company doesn't require tobacco users to pay a health care insurance premium.\n\nA gradual trend\n\nOther states where U-Haul's new no-nicotine hiring policy will be implemented are Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.\n\nNo-nicotine hiring policies began to surface more prominently several years ago, especially at hospitals and other health businesses, but relatively few companies have adopted them.\n\nOne exception is Alaska Airlines, which has had a no-nicotine policy since 1985. The program has been \"largely successful\" with most employees \"grateful for the pro-health stance of the company,\" said Alexis Myers, a company spokeswoman.\n\nAlaska Airlines implemented the policy for two key reasons. The first involved health-care costs and health consequences for the workforce, she said. The second reflected the difficulty of smoking on planes and in many places around airports.\n\n\"Many jobs at an airline are not conducive to taking nicotine breaks, and customer service may be negatively impacted by employees who are experiencing nicotine withdrawal,\" Myers added.\n\nAs a general rule, job applicants at the airline must be nicotine-free for at least six months before seeking employment.\n\nPeople who apply for U-Haul jobs in Arizona and the other affected states will see statements discussing the nicotine-free hiring policy on applications, and they will be questioned about their nicotine use.\n\nIn states where testing is allowed, applicants might need to undergo nicotine screening in the future.\n\nCareer opportunities with the company can be viewed at uhauljobs.com.\n\nReach the reporter at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Russ Wiles"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "The Phoenix-based company, which employs around 4,000 people in Arizona, expects the policy will help create a more healthy corporate culture.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/sites/azcentral/images/favicon.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815248536, app-argument=https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2020/01/01/u-haul-wont-hire-smokers-arizona-other-states-feb-1/2783549001/money/business/jobs", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "U-Haul to stop hiring smokers and nicotine users in Arizona, 20 other states", "description": "The Phoenix-based company, which employs around 4,000 people in Arizona, expects the policy will help create a more healthy corporate culture.", "site_name": "Arizona Republic", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/04/09/PPHX/46d36cef-13b4-421a-a486-f19a99186f5d-uhaul.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3071,1727,x1,y60&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "description": "The Phoenix-based company, which employs around 4,000 people in Arizona, expects the policy will help create a more healthy corporate culture.", "twitter": {"site": "@azcentral", "creator": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "canonical_link": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2020/01/01/u-haul-wont-hire-smokers-arizona-other-states-feb-1/2783549001/"}
