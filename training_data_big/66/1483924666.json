Police said paper sky lanterns launched nearby to celebrate the arrival of 2020 were probably to blame.\n\nSeveral witnesses saw cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight Wednesday near the Krefeld Zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city\u2019s head of criminal police, told reporters.\n\n\u201cPeople reported seeing those sky lanterns flying at low altitude near the zoo and then it started burning,\u201d Hoppmann said.\n\nHe said investigators also found used lanterns on the ground that hadn\u2019t burned entirely. They were 34 centimetres long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would be suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.\n\nPolice and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38 a.m.\n\nThe zoo near the Dutch border said its entire ape house burned down and more than 30 animals \u2014 including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys \u2014 were killed, as well as fruit bats and birds.\n\nOnly two chimpanzees were able to be rescued from the flames by firefighters. They suffered burns but are in stable condition, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,\u201d Dressen said, adding that many of the zoo\u2019s animal handlers were in shock at the devastation.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\n\u201cWe have to seriously work through the mourning process,\u201d Dressen said. \u201cThis is an unfathomable tragedy.\u201d\n\nHe said many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild.\n\nThe zoo said the Gorilla Garden, which is near its devastated Ape House, didn\u2019t go up in flames and that gorilla Kidogo and six other members of his family are alive.\n\nGermans usually welcome in the new year with fireworks at midnight and people are allowed to buy and launch fireworks. Sky lanterns, however, are both illegal and uncommon in Krefeld and most of Germany. The mini hot-air balloons made of paper have been used in Asia for centuries.\n\nAfter requests by police for witnesses to come forward, Krefeld police said several people had come in and were being interrogated. Police said they would not release details on them.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

It closed after the fire and plans to remain closed Thursday.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["smg2_world", "smg_europe", "smg2_news"], "tags": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Grieshaber", "The Associated Press"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "BERLIN - A fire raced through a zoo in western Germany in the first few minutes of the new year, killing more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys...", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/favicon-thestar.ico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicon-thestar-144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicon-thestar-70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicon-thestar-150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicon-thestar-310.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379481068", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "thestar.com", "application-name": "thestar.com", "fb": {"pages": 134392236659479}, "storyuuid": "1e65ae4a31c9c57c3c1b0d4fa56714c8", "description": "BERLIN - A fire raced through a zoo in western Germany in the first few minutes of the new year, killing more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys...", "keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "news_keywords": "smg2_world,smg_europe,smg2_news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/torontostar", "published_time": "2020-01-01", "modified_time": "2020-01-01T19:16:18.717Z", "section": "Europe"}, "og": {"title": "Apes, monkeys among more than 30 animals killed in German zoo inferno", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/fire-kills-animals-at-zoo-in-western-germany.html", "description": "BERLIN - A fire raced through a zoo in western Germany in the first few minutes of the new year, killing more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys...", "site_name": "thestar.com", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/LpE82ciS5KyToUhPq4kP1Bn5N64=/0x0:1280x853/1280x853/smart/filters:cb(1577906420539)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/apes-monkeys-among-30-animals-killed-in-german-zoo-fire/LBJ101-11_2020_093948.jpg", "images": "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/thestar-ribbon.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thestar.com", "site": "@TorontoStar", "title": "Apes, monkeys among more than 30 animals killed in German zoo inferno", "description": "BERLIN - A fire raced through a zoo in western Germany in the first few minutes of the new year, killing more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys...", "image": "https://images.thestar.com/LpE82ciS5KyToUhPq4kP1Bn5N64=/0x0:1280x853/1280x853/smart/filters:cb(1577906420539)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/apes-monkeys-among-30-animals-killed-in-german-zoo-fire/LBJ101-11_2020_093948.jpg", "creator": "Kirsten Grieshaber"}, "parsely-title": "Apes, monkeys among more than 30 animals killed in German zoo inferno", "parsely-link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/fire-kills-animals-at-zoo-in-western-germany.html", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-author": "Kirsten Grieshaber", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.thestar.com/v1K0zgU9lRZDUoec6WdHS3QSZYs=/0x0:1280x853/93x62/smart/filters:cb(1577906420539)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/apes-monkeys-among-30-animals-killed-in-german-zoo-fire/LBJ101-11_2020_093948.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2020-01-01T16:59:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "Europe", "parsely-tags": "smg2_world, smg_europe, smg2_news, word count: 350-700 words, includes photo gallery", "parsely-metadata": "{\"storyuuid\": \"1e65ae4a31c9c57c3c1b0d4fa56714c8\"}"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/europe/2020/01/01/fire-kills-animals-at-zoo-in-western-germany.html"}
