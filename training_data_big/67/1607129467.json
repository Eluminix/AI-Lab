The company was unable to say what eventually would happen to the planes given lack of demand for aircraft at the moment but it was clear they would not fly for Lufthansa again.\n\nThe statement gave a downbeat assessment of the prospects for a recovery in air travel, saying that management \"does not expect a quick return of the air travel industry to the level before the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"By its estimation it will take months, before the global travel restrictions are fully lifted and years before worldwide demand for air travel corresponds to the pre-crisis level.\"\n\nThe company said it was ceasing operations for its Germanwings brand, speeding up a move already decided before the crisis. Its Eurowings low-cost division would retire 10 Airbus A320s, while its SWISS, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines group members would also reduce their fleets, in the case of SWISS by foregoing delivery of already ordered aircraft.\n\nCurrently 700 of the group's 760 planes are parked as air traffic has dwindled.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["Airbus SE", "Austrian Airlines", "Boeing", "Brussels Airlines", "Eurowings", "Frankfurt", "Frankfurt", "Brandenburg", "Germany", "Germanwings", "Germany", "Lufthansa", "Munich", "Munich", "Bavaria", "Germany", "THE BOEING COMPANY", "airbus", "Austrian Airlines AG", "Deutsche Lufthansa Aktiengesellschaft", "Germanwings GmbH", "BRUSSELS AIRLINES N.V.", "Airbus A340", "Airlines", "Aviation", "European Regions Airline Association", "Eurowings GmbH", "Low-cost Carriers", "Star Alliance", "Swiss International Air Lines"], "tags": ["Airbus SE", "Germanwings", "Brussels Airlines", "Frankfurt,Brandenburg,Germany", "Austrian Airlines", "Eurowings", "Frankfurt", "Boeing"], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Http"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 German airline group Lufthansa said it was permanently removing some of its large aircraft from service and reducing capacity for the long term, saying it will take years for demand for air travel to return to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic.", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "/resources/assets/wlos/images/logos/favicon-32x32.png", "meta_data": {"package-version": "1.0.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=379151768", "Story-Content-Type": "text/html", "title": "Lufthansa retires big jets, says rebound could take years", "description": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) &mdash;
