We\u2019re sorry about this and we\u2019re working to have it back to normal soon.\u201d\n\nBy lunchtime the three brands said internet and mobile banking were back to normal. They tweeted: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the issues with it this morning. Thanks for your messages.\u201d\n\nThe issue prevented customers from logging in via the web and the mobile app. Telephone banking, card payments and ATM transactions were not affected. The bank said it was an internal problem, not a cybersecurity one, which its IT team had now fixed.\n\nWith 22 million current account customers, Lloyds Banking Group is the UK\u2019s largest provider and also offers the most \u201cbasic\u201d bank accounts. It has 13 million active online customers, of which more than 9 million are mobile users. All of them were potentially affected.\n\nA spokeswoman was unable to say whether customers would receive any compensation but added that anyone who had incurred charges as a result of the outage should get in touch with their bank.\n\nAngry customers reported on social media that they could not access banking services from their computers or smartphones and had been locked out of their accounts for hours. Many also complained that they had not been given a timescale for when online services would be back up and running again.\n\nCustomers were told to call their bank if they needed to transfer funds urgently, but some said they were unable to get through, and complained they were put on hold for a long time before being cut off.\n\nOne customer asked Lloyds whether it would waive his overdraft fee, and the bank told him to raise this with its customer service team.\n\nDue to this issue, can you waive my OD fee? Yes or no will be appericated. Not palm me to a phone number. Thank you. \u2014 Dan Houghton (@DanHoughton_) January 1, 2020\n\nNice New Years start @LloydsBank .. Internet banking and mobile banking, not working. And don\u2019t say, \u201cwe are trying to fix it\u201d. Can I do my job now? No. That\u2019s enough for me to change a bank. This MUST NEVER happen.

NatWest\u2019s online and mobile phone app crashed on Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year.\n\nBy far the worst meltdown was at TSB last year, caused by the change to a new IT platform before it had been fully tested. It resulted in almost 1.9 million customers being locked out of their accounts and the problems took months to fully resolve.\n\nIn October, MPs warned that IT failures in the banking sector were running at an unacceptable rate.\n\nThe Treasury select committee said customers were being left \u201ccashless and cut off\u201d after problems at several financial groups, adding: \u201cThe current level and frequency of disruption and consumer harm is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nWith bank branches and cash machines disappearing, customers are increasingly reliant on online banking services, but these have been severely disrupted by IT failures at firms including TSB, Visa, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, the committee said.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Julia Kollewe"], "publish_date": "Wed Jan  1 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking are back to normal", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://static.guim.co.uk/images/favicon-32x32.ico", "meta_data": {"description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking are back to normal", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7904dc38e7343159753f992f301150330761c2eb/43_70_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6fcb6cd2389e1d04503d64735f44e4c1", "height": 720}, "title": "Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland online banking systems crash", "description": "Millions of customers were affected but online and mobile banking are back to normal", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juliakollewe", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2020-01-03T12:26:16.000Z", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2020-01-01T17:36:55.000Z", "tag": "Banking,Lloyds Banking Group,Business,UK news,Consumer affairs,Money"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash", "iphone": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7904dc38e7343159753f992f301150330761c2eb/43_70_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=aa10da099e00752ca20b3072eea73b4a", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/01/lloyds-halifax-and-bank-of-scotland-online-banking-systems-crash"}
