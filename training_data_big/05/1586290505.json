The regulation will apply from Monday, April 27.\n\nLast Thursday, the state government had previously decided on a \"mask directive\" without any obligation. Over the weekend, Prime Minister Markus S\u00f6der (CSU) apparently changed his mind.\n\nTherefore, at the same time as numerous shops will be opened again and the return of first classes to schools from next week, there will be an obligation to wear a mask, S\u00f6der announced. This does not mean the obligation to wear medical protective masks, but the so-called everyday masks or scarves, if they cover mouth and nose.\n\nBavaria is the first West German state to introduce such a regulation.\n\nIn addition, the Prime Minister announced support for parents: In view of the closure of cr\u00e8ches, kindergartens and after-school care centers, the Free State of Bavaria will take over the childcare fees - initially for three months. A closure ordered by the state should not be at the financial expense of the parents.\n\nA professional group that has so far received little attention from the state government should also receive more support: According to S\u00f6der, the approximately 30,000 artists in Bavaria who do not receive any renumeration due to cancelled performances and events, are to receive 1,000 euros per month for the next three months. \"Bavaria is a cultural state, and we do not want to leave the art scene and artists alone,\" the CSU leader emphasized.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["German private health insurance", "engineering jobs", "art", "culture", "science", "travel", "business", "politics", "technology", "expatriate", "health"], "tags": [], "authors": ["The Eye Newspapers", "Alexandra Rau Is A Journalist", "Section Editor", "News", "For Tme."], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "News covering business, health, engineering jobs, art, culture, science, travel, business and politics.
