The bill for the annual shindig wen up, despite the Bank promising MP it was keeping expenditure under review. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains: Spending on the Bank of England\u2019s summer party crept closer to \u00a3100,000 this year despite Threadneedle Street promising MPs it would put the expensive event under review. Figures released by the central bank showed that party planners racked up a bill of \u00a396,188 on the event, which hosted nearly 2,500 staff and their families at the Bank\u2019s sports club in Roehampton, south-west London in July. Costs for the annual party \u2013 known as Governors\u2019 Day \u2013 included more than \u00a352,200 on food and soft drinks and nearly \u00a330,000 on family entertainment, which in 2018 involved a treasure hunt, bake-off competition, fun run and bouncy castle. That was on top of nearly \u00a32,000 for equipment and \u00a312,000 for \u201cother\u201d undisclosed expenses. The total is slightly higher than the \u00a395,673 spent on Governors\u2019 Day in 2018, and while the increase is marginal \u2013 about \u00a3515 \u2013 it will raise questions over whether the bank is serious about reviewing its costs...

Speaking on CNBC, Navarro predicted the Dow would jump to 32,000, from 28,462 last night. That would be a gain of 12%, on top of the 22% gains seen in 2019.

Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPA Newsflash: Greece\u2019s stock market has ended 2019 up a remarkable 50%. During the eurozone crisis, the idea of Greece\u2019s\u2019 stock exchange outpacing the rest of Europe would have sounded quite bizarre. But as 2019 drew to a close, the Athens bourse was \u2013 by some distance \u2013 the best-performing European exchange.\n\nThe Athens General Index (ATG) of Greece\u2019s 60 biggest firms has just closed at 916 points, close to last week\u2019s five-year high. It started the year at 613 points. Two factors drove the rally. Greece\u2019s bailout ended in August 2018, after a grim eight-year grind of spending cuts and tax rises that drove the country into a deep recession. Greece has now rolled back the capital controls enforced in 2015 to prevent a run on its banks, but still has to hit challenging budget surplus targets. Second, the left-wing Syriza government of Alexis Tsipras was replaced in July 2019 by a more market-friendly right-wing administration. PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis is now cutting taxes, and pledging to abolish regulations and slash red tape. Mr Mitsotakis declared in September.\n\n\u201cOne stone at a time, we\u2019re setting the foundations of the country\u2019s regeneration.\u201d Banks had a particularly strong year, with Attica and Piraeus both gaining over 250% in 2019. Utility companies and infrastructure providers also rallied, as Athens looks for more investment from overseas.\n\nBut long-term investors have still suffered badly. Back in 2007, when the credit crunch struck, the ATG was trading at over 5,200 points. It was still at 2,000 \u2013 more than double today\u2019s levels \u2013 when the first bailout request landed in 2010.

The FTSE 100 index of top UK-listed shares has closed at 7,542 points. That\u2019s a 12.1% gain for the year, as it ended 2018 at just 6728. But the rally ended with a whimper. The FTSE 100 ended the last, shortened, trading day down 44 points or 0.6%. That\u2019s its second daily fall in a row, following 11 days of rising prices in the aftermath of Boris Johnson\u2019s election win. Trading was very light today, with many investors already wrapped up for the year. There have also been signs of profit-taking in recent days, after global markets enjoyed their best year in a decade. Athletics fashion chain JD Sports was the top riser in London, gaining 140% in the last 12 months as it continues to defy the high street crisis. Housebuilders also had a good year, with Barratt and Taylor Wimpey both gaining 50%. David Madden of CMC Markets says the construction industry should benefit from the resolution of the Brexit crisis, although there are still uncertainties ahead: The solid win by the Conservative party in the recent general election helped drive up the share price of the house builders, but there has been a new development on the Brexit front. Judging by the plans Prime Minister Johnson has, a no-deal Brexit after the transition period at the end of 2020 might be an option, so uncertainty could continue to hang over the housing industry in 2020. There has been a belief in certain sections of the City that investment has been delayed because of Brexit, so we could see more of that. On the plus slide for the housing market, the Bank of England are unlikely to hike rates until Brexit has been wrapped up.

He writes: As the decade comes to an end, it is clear the global stock market rally that began in March 2009 continues to be in place. The Nasdaq and the S&P rose 34.8% and 28.5% respectively. This is a contrast to the depressed levels in December 2018 following the end of year decline in 2018. If we compare with September 2018, the S&P 500 is up a more modest but still respectable 9.8%. Markets have also been very calm and stock market volatility as measured by the S&P VIX has been remarkably low for most of 2019.

Share\n\n31 Dec 2019 12.21 CET What a difference a year makes. China\u2019s stock market had a torrid 2018, slumping by 24%, which was the worst performance by a major index. But 2019 has been much brighter. The Shanghai and Shenzen markets have clawed back all those losses, rallying by a third this year. Last year\u2019s plunge forced policymakers to act -- by easing monetary policy and raising government spending. The deepening trade dispute with America also forced policymakers to halt efforts to deleverage the economy, and focus on propping up growth.\n\nZhou Longgang, an analyst with Huachuang Securities, says: \u201cThe sharp correction in 2018 pushed valuations of China stocks to record lows, prompting a recovery in 2019, as Beijing rolled out supportive measures to boost the economy.\u201d View image in fullscreen 2019 was a bad year for stock market bears, as Beijing pandered to demands for more stimulus Photograph: STR/AFP via Getty Images Share\n\n31 Dec 2019 11.56 CET Did Carlos Ghosn hide in instrument case to avoid facing the music?

Last night, the former boss of Renault-Nissan popped up in Beirut - a major surprise, as he was under strict controls in Tokyo facing financial misconduct charges. Ghosn, who has denied defrauding the car giant, says he has \u201cescaped injustice\u201d. In a stern statement, he accusing the Japanese system of assuming guilt and being rigged against him, with a trial expected to start next year. He insists: \u201cI have not fled justice \u2013 I have escaped injustice and political persecution.\u201d But how did Ghosn leave Japan, given he had surrendered all his passports? He was also being tracked by police, having been charged with understating his salary and transferring $5m of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest. One theory, worthy of a Hollywood film, is that he made his getaway in a musical instrument case! I can read a million words on how car boss Carlos Ghosn escaped 24 hour surveillance in Japan to flee by private jet to Lebanon. Beirut sources saying he hid in a box designed for a musical instrument. Double bass, presumably. \u2014 Lionel Barber (@lionelbarber) December 31, 2019 The theory is that a group of \u2018musicians\u2019 turned up at the Ghosn residence in Tokyo for a performance, and left with the former auto magnate crammed into one of their boxes.....

The CSI 300 index, which contains the biggest companies on the Shanghai and Shenzen markets, has rallied by 36% since January. That\u2019s quite surprising, given the damage caused to China\u2019s economy by the US trade war. But policymakers have responded to slowing growth by pledging new stimulus measures, cutting borrowing costs and trying to boost infrastructure spending.

This despite \u201cTrump\u2019s trade deal in the bag,\u201d according to the President\u2019s hawkish trade adviser Peter Navarro.
