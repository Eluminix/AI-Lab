NM: It’s a massive point for us. It’s a busy period, we had a lot of games. I am very happy for the team and happy for Ali’s goal. I think we controlled the whole game and they are a good team so we are quite happy with the point. AJ: It is a great feeling to be involved with such important games. I have been working hard. It has been a long time coming but I am happy to help the team. It has been a hard time for me and I am happy to turn it around. It has been tough. I had a good feeling. The last game and now this game, I had a feeling I could make the difference. When Dunky gave me the ball I tried to hit it as hard as possible and then the only thing was the bicycle kick. I have done it and it went in the right direction, I think it was the best goal of my career."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"5e0cad958f08c397226431ac","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73bf9d9b56a63a6b8a8f88caecef3db0","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=a69e44a09c6cf6f008b90fc0864b0dc3","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=65c66f9bfb6e862938258a4f04a9889c","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=472b9d335b1987c1e469792e6d7417fe"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"John Brewin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-brewin"}],"datePublished":"2020-01-01T14:51:56.000Z","headline":"Brighton 1-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","dateModified":"2022-10-19T15:23:34.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/01/brighton-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","articleBody":"Safe to say that Alireza Jahanbakhsh has scored the goal of the decade so far, with apologies to Jack Grealish."},{"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"http://schema.org","@id":"5e0cac558f08c397226431a7","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","@context":"https://schema.org","@id":"https://www.theguardian.com#publisher","name":"The Guardian","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/31/TheGuardian_AMP.png","width":190,"height":60},"sameAs":["https://www.facebook.com/theguardian","https://twitter.com/guardian","https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian"]},"isAccessibleForFree":true,"image":["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=73bf9d9b56a63a6b8a8f88caecef3db0","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=a69e44a09c6cf6f008b90fc0864b0dc3","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=900&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=65c66f9bfb6e862938258a4f04a9889c","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf134789a35a59d80b88ab7d0214851a870d6120/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=472b9d335b1987c1e469792e6d7417fe"],"author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"John Brewin","sameAs":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-brewin"}],"datePublished":"2020-01-01T14:51:56.000Z","headline":"Brighton 1-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened","dateModified":"2022-10-19T15:23:34.000Z","mainEntityOfPage":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/01/brighton-v-chelsea-premier-league-live","articleBody":"Final score: Burnley 1-2 Aston Villa.

I have been working hard. It has been a long time coming but I am happy to help the team. It has been a hard time for me and I am happy to turn it around. It has been tough. I had a good feeling. The last game and now this game, I had a feeling I could make the difference. When Dunky gave me the ball I tried to hit it as hard as possible and then the only thing was the bicycle kick. I have done it and it went in the right direction, I think it was the best goal of my career.</p>
