We listened very carefully to what the unions have had to say, obviously, but they certainly weren\u2019t the only voice in the room.\u201d\n\nThe head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said the government needed to prioritise supporting casual workers who would be forced to take unpaid time off work to ensure the coronavirus was \u201ccontained and controlled\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen ACTU secretary Sally McManus listens as industrial relations minister Christian Porter speaks during the coronavirus roundtable.

I mean, there will always be a temptation to have industrial action when it has the greatest effect,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIndustrial action of any type at the moment would have a very, very large and negative effect. The reality is that there are already businesses suffering from disruptions to supply chains \u2013 that will mean that it will become harder for them to produce the goods and services that we all rely on every day.\u201d", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Amy Remeikis"], "publish_date": "Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 2020", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1790b5ac2bd9dff79149deb17eb0cdad8547c25d/587_148_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=08c29534711ce0b51dd387b8e6c6d944", "height": 720}, "title": "Australian government won't 'jump to a solution' to help casual workers in coronavirus crisis", "description": "A roundtable discussion led by Christian Porter produces no concrete solutions for vulnerable workers", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amy-remeikis", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2020-07-01T17:17:44.000Z", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2020-03-10T06:12:07.000Z", "tag": "Coronavirus,Industrial relations,Australian politics,Australian trade unions,Business,Australia news,Australian economy,Coalition,Labor party,Christian Porter"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@amyremeikis", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1790b5ac2bd9dff79149deb17eb0cdad8547c25d/587_148_4750_2850/master/4750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMjAucG5n&s=2109b2189f7773d3d078aa0ddc1a9126", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/australian-government-warned-not-to-drag-its-feet-on-help-for-casual-workers-in-coronavirus-crisis"}
