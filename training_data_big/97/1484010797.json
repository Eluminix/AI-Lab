Nissan accused Kelly, who is American, of \u201cdeep involvement\u201d in his boss\u2019s misconduct. This included the underreporting of Ghosn\u2019s pay packets, which had faced criticism as being excessive. Both have denied all allegations against them.\n\nKelly, a lawyer by training who joined Nissan in 1988, rose steadily through the carmaker\u2019s human resources division. Ghosn arrived in 1999 with a mandate to turn round the struggling company, with a key ally in Kelly, who became the first American to join Nissan\u2019s board in June 2012.\n\n\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission said in September that Kelly gave Ghosn \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to conceal more than $90m (\u00a368m) of pay, along with a boost of more than $50m to his retirement package. Kelly paid a $100,000 penalty to settle the SEC charges, without admitting or denying guilt, and was barred as a US company director for five years.\n\nKelly was released from the Tokyo detention centre \u2013 where he and Ghosn spent long periods \u2013 on Christmas Day 2018. Ghosn\u2019s escape will now thrust the spotlight on the trial of his former righthand man.\n\nIt will also heighten scrutiny of Japan\u2019s notoriously harsh justice system, which experts say ill befits one of the world\u2019s most advanced economies. A widely cited 99.8% conviction rate for those charged with crimes has led to criticism that judges give prosecutors too much credence, while the country still retains the death penalty for more serious crimes.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nIn April, more than 1,000 Japanese academics and lawyers \u2013 including Ghosn\u2019s lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka \u2013 signed a letter organised by Human Rights Watch criticising Japan\u2019s hitojichi-shiho, or \u201chostage justice\u201d system. Suspects can be detained for long periods, questioned without their lawyers present, and barred from access to their families \u2013 as was the case for Ghosn.\n\nKenneth Roth, the non-governmental organisation\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cAmong the conditions of Japan\u2019s justice system that Carlos Ghosn fled was a prohibition of communicating with his wife \u2013 part of the pressure to induce confessions even out of formal custody.\u201d\n\nThe Ghosn case also highlights the potential for abuse of a 23-day detention limit, with prosecutors regularly rearresting suspects on minor variations of original charges in order to continue questioning.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": ["Jasper Jolly"], "publish_date": "Tue Dec 31 00:00:00 2019", "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Ex-Nissan boss\u2019s flight to Lebanon also renews focus on Japan\u2019s much-criticised justice system", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/static/frontend/icons/homescreen/apple-touch-icon.svg", "meta_data": {"description": "Ex-Nissan boss\u2019s flight to Lebanon also renews focus on Japan\u2019s much-criticised justice system", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7e331b0543a8403c1c33c8ef6f55842b82800b8/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bb5c825d580a1ff0837dde39e5f32dac", "height": 720}, "title": "Carlos Ghosn's escape puts spotlight on the former aide left behind", "description": "Ex-Nissan boss\u2019s flight to Lebanon also renews focus on Japan\u2019s much-criticised justice system", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jasper-jolly", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2019-12-31T20:10:04.000Z", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2019-12-31T13:24:32.000Z", "tag": "Carlos Ghosn,Nissan,Japan,Automotive industry,Business,Renault,Asia Pacific,World news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind", "iphone": "gnmguardian://business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jjpjolly", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7e331b0543a8403c1c33c8ef6f55842b82800b8/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTkucG5n&s=143bfe8c90785c0604a4af30315e32d6", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/31/carlos-ghosns-escape-puts-spotlight-on-the-former-aide-man-left-behind"}
