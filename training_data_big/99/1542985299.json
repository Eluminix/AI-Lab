It was junk, sent by an unknown third party who is not using FeedBlitz to send their emails or manage their RSS feeds. FeedBlitz hasn\u2019t been hacked; we just didn\u2019t send you that email or generate that link. And if you got this link in an email, since we did not send you that email, we can\u2019t unsubscribe you from it. If you\u2019re here and want to stop spam like the email that brought you to this page, or hate hackers tricking you with phishing links at malware sites, we think that\u2019s great and we sympathize. We want that too! But we\u2019re sorry; we can\u2019t help you. We didn\u2019t send that email or make that link.\n\nBottom line: If you\u2019re here, the email you\u2019re looking at isn\u2019t a genuine FeedBlitz email, or the link isn\u2019t a genuine FeedBlitz link.\n\nSo: How did you get here?\n\nBut there\u2019s a FeedBlitz link in the email, in the feed, on that web site! Yes. Yes, there is. The spammers who are trying to trick you do not use FeedBlitz. But they are using a bit of FeedBlitz to camouflage their links. This makes you think that the email (or link) came from FeedBlitz, a reputable email service. But \u2026 just because there is a link to FeedBlitz in the email, or on that site, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ours. It isn\u2019t.\n\nYou got here because we really, really hate spammers and hackers. We don\u2019t like them trying to trick people. And we really don\u2019t like them trying to trick people by pretending to be us.\n\nRemember that bit of FeedBlitz they were trying to hide behind? We are now using that against them, and helping you by not letting you click through to whatever junk site is trying to fleece you, infect you, or do whatever no good it\u2019s up to. Which explains why you are safely here, and not on some icky web site trying to harm you.\n\nSo \u2026 What?\n\nFeedBlitz didn\u2019t send you the email or generate the link, that got you here.\n\nFeedBlitz hasn\u2019t been hacked, either.\n\nWe can\u2019t unsubscribe you, because we didn\u2019t send the email to you, if that\u2019s how you got here.\n\nBad people have tried to trick you by abusing a feature we make available to genuine web site owners.\n\nAnd you\u2019re here because we hate spammers and have stopped them.\n\nNext Steps?\n\nDelete the email. Update your anti-virus software.\n\nIf you\u2019re a FeedBlitz client or subscriber then you should not see this message from an email that actually was sent by us, or a feed managed by us. Contact support (link is in the top menu bar) if you need further help should our algorithms have incorrectly blocked a genuine link of yours.", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": [""], "tags": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "", "meta_lang": "en", "meta_favicon": "https://www.feedblitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fb-icon_270-150x150.png", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Junk Email, Fake Link, Now What?", "description": "Hi there.
