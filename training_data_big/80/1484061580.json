Photo / Supplied\n\nIn other cases the boats might be sold for what looks like a bargain, until the new owner realised how much work it took to repair and maintain.\n\nAs these vessels aged them being abandoned was increasing and it was difficult to identify owners, Hayton said.\n\nWhile the moorings were registered, there was no boat registration in New Zealand.\n\n\"Some people put dead boats onto moorings to dump them, so it is quite easy to shirk responsibility.\"\n\nThere was no typical process, rather the harbourmaster's team would take note of what looked like an abandoned boat, and seek to find the owner.\n\n\"It is quite easy to tell when they've been abandoned. There might be excessive growth on it, seagulls nesting, or even trees growing on them. They can be real eyesores.\"\n\nIf the owner could not be identified, under the Maritime Act they were required to place a notice on the vessel, an advertisement in the Herald, and contact police.\n\nHarbourmaster Andrew Hayton says it is \"easy to tell\" when a boat has been abandoned. Photo / Supplied\n\nIf no owner came forward they would then seek to sell the vessel, but if it was beyond repair they would salvage what they could and dispose of the rest.\n\nThe process could cost anywhere between a few hundred dollars up to $30,000, the higher figure especially if the boat had sunk, as it would require divers.\n\nThere were about six boats going through that process now, but about 200 throughout Auckland's waters Hayton and his team are keeping an eye on.\n\nHayton said rather than simply abandoning boats owners should get in touch with the harbourmaster.\n\n\"The onus is on boat owners to keep their vessels seaworthy. But we understand people can fall on hard times, or people pass away and the boat be left with others.\n\n\"If you are unable to look after it, please just get in touch with us and we'll do what we can to help.\n\n\"Getting onto it sooner you might be able to recover some costs, whereas leaving it will end up costing more money.\"\n\nAuckland Yacht and Boating Association chair Ian Clouston said a lot of boats were abandoned because the costs of maintaining them were so high.\n\n\"You might be looking at 15 to 20 per cent of the boat's value in maintenance a year, so with rising living costs and berthing fees some people simply can't afford it.\"\n\nSelling boats was also more difficult these days, with them being classed as \"luxury items\".\n\nHe urged people to get onto the problem sooner than later, rather than abandoning them on random moorings.\n\n\"It is very irresponsible, and if you don't know the strength of the mooring the boat could be blown off in a storm.\"", "keywords": [], "meta_keywords": ["aucklands", "ghost", "ships", "number", "of", "abandoned", "vessels", "surge", "and", "boaties", "are", "footing", "the", "bill", "hundreds", "litter", "waters", "require", "recovery", "costing", "ratepayers", "thousands", "dollars"], "tags": ["Central Hawke's Bay", "TV", "Marlborough", "The Front Page", "Taranaki", "Katikati", "Rowing", "USA", "Kea Kids news", "Adventure travel", "Nelson-Tasman", "Morning quiz", "Ski holidays", "NZ Open", "Rural technology", "Dunedin", "Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Middle East", "Stratford", "All Otago", "Europe", "Horowhenua", "Stewart Island", "New Zealand", "Property Insider", "Te Puke", "Analysis", "Kaikohe", "Matamata & Piako", "Tokoroa & South Waikato", "West Coast", "Quizzes", "Shop fashion", "Invercargill", "Opinion", "Palmerston North", "Upper Hutt", "All Canterbury", "Afternoon quiz", "Wanaka", "Auckland", "Cooking the Books", "Books", "Otago / Queenstown", "Recipe collections", "Movie reviews", "Book reviews", "UK", "Balclutha", "Kapiti", "Scam Update", "United States", "Music reviews", "Budget 2025", "Manawat\u016b", "Shop home & living", "Movies", "All Quizzes", "All Opinion", "Canterbury", "Whangarei", "Tauranga", "Society Insider", "Health", "Wellington", "Far North", "Business analysis", "Dargaville", "Africa", "Lower Hutt", "Music", "Restaurant reviews", "Mangawhai", "Shop beauty", "The Little Things", "Shop entertainment", "Milford's Investing Place", "Sex & relationships", "New Plymouth", "Premium opinion", "Napier", "Social media", "Health & wellbeing", "Otago", "Southland", "Mount Maunganui", "Motueka", "All Manawat\u016b - Whanganui", "Ashburton", "Gore", "Deloitte Top 200 Awards", "AI", "All Taranaki", "Nelson", "Tasman", "Asia", "Editorials", "Cambridge", "Cruise holidays", "Bay of Islands", "Cartoons", "Culture", "Rail holidays", "Oamaru", "Australia", "Taup\u014d & T\u016brangi", "Northland", "On The Up", "Sports quiz", "Coromandel & Hauraki", "Whakat\u0101ne", "Wairoa", "Open Justice", "P\u0101p\u0101moa", "All Wellington", "Animal health", "Pets & animals", "Letters to the editor", "Kerikeri", "Reviews", "All Southland", "H\u0101wera", "On the Tiles", "Hastings", "Queenstown", "Shop gifts", "Alexandra", "International travel", "Wairarapa", "Pacific", "Fashion & beauty", "Te Awamutu", "Best NZ beaches", "Luxury travel", "Christchurch", "Ask me Anything", "Kaipara", "Kaik\u014dura", "Havelock North", "Timaru", "Hamilton", "Food & drink", "Pacific Islands"], "authors": ["Michael"], "publish_date": null, "summary": "", "article_html": "", "meta_description": "Hundreds of ghost ships litter Auckland's waters and require recovery, costing ratepayers hundreds of thousands of dollars.
